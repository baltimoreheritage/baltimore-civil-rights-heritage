During and after the Civil War, the cemetery became the site of burial for 300 black veterans. The veterans buried at Laurel Cemetery were displaced to Loudon Park Cemetery by road construction in 1886 and 1911. In 1957, two members of the state legislature introduced a bill to remove the cemetery, arguing that it had become a health hazard. After the legislation passed, members of the city's Law Department formed a dummy corporation and bought the cemetery, more than 30 acres of prime land, for $100. Court action taken by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on behalf of several plot holders failed to halt the new owners' actions. By then it was too late. Bulldozers had overturned the grounds, paving the way for a future department store and adjoining parking lot. Through subsequent resale and legal maneuvering, the property was sold to Vornado Corp.

In August 2009, the Morgan Christian Center trustees deeded the property to Morgan State University and the Center was renamed the Morgan State University Memorial Chapel, to reflect the diverse religious landscape on campus. The building was designed by Towson-born African American architect Alfred Irvin Cassell who designed a number of buildings on the Morgan State campus. Beginning in 1944, the director of the Morgan Christian Center was Rev. Howard L. Cornish—a 1927 graduate of Morgan State and math professor.

Morris Soper Residence,building,Extant,102 W. 39th Street,Tuscany-Canterbury,Baltimore,21210,,,,,Dwelling,Judge Morris Ames Soper,,"The former residence of Judge Morris Soper. Morris Ames Soper’s (1873-1963) judicial service spanned more than a half-century. In 1898 Soper was appointed Assistant State’s Attorney for Baltimore City and was promoted to Assistant United States Attorney for the State of Maryland in 1900. In 1923 President Harding appointed Soper to the Federal bench where he served as a District Judge, and by 1931 President Hoover had elevated him to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals representing Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Maryland in the Fourth Circuit. Most notably, Soper worked towards full equality for African-Americans. He viewed equality as “not only a matter of law, but a matter of conscience.” As early as 1937, Soper—from his position as Chairman of the State Commission on Higher Education for Negroes—was urging the Maryland legislature to admit African-Americans to the University of Maryland graduate departments. National attention was focused on Soper when he decided many of the early school desegregation cases that reached the Federal Courts in the wake of Brown vs the Board of Education in 1954. In 1955 Soper handed down the decision that required the University of North Carolina to admit three African-American students into its undergraduate college. The following year he wrote majority opinions on racial integration in Virginia public schools. Judge Soper served for over 30 years on the Board of Trustees at Morgan State College, and was chairman for much of the latter half of his tenure. He is credited as being instrumental in transforming the institution from a private college to a state supported institution.",,,14,39.33614661,-76.62093038,,,,,,,Prominent Person,,,,d63b0e,building,,marylandhistoricalsocietylibrary_morris,excerpt,MD,house,medium,Coleman Directories,,,,,,,,,"https://maps.google.com/?layer=c&cbll=39.3361466055794,-76.6209303800429",,,,7/20/2017 12:48pm

Between 1970 and 1990, Super Pride grew to seven locations, employing more than 400 people, and making over $43 million in annual sales. Under Burns’ leadership, Super Pride sponsored Black History Month activities and supported the Arena Players.

In the fall of 2000, Super Pride closed all eight of its locations and, in November, held an auction to liquidate the stores and their remaining equipment to satisfy creditors.",1970,,13,39.30281800,-76.58499100,,,1968-1976,,1970,1990,,1968-1976,Employment,,d63b0e,grocery,,,draft,MD,,medium,,,,,,,,,,"https://maps.google.com/?layer=c&cbll=39.302818,-76.584991",,,,7/20/2017 12:48pm
"Tennis Courts, Druid Hill Park",landscape,Partial,2600 Madison Avenue,Reservoir Hill,Baltimore,21217,,,,,Park,,,"On July 17, 1943, the Baltimore Board of Recreation and Parks received a letter from Dallas F. Nicholas on behalf of the all-black Baltimore Tennis Club. In no uncertain terms, Nicholas requested an end to the segregation of tennis courts at Druid Hill Park. In a fit of either willful misrepresentation or complete ignorance, the General Superintendent stated that it was ―a misstatement to say that the tennis courts assigned to negro players were inferior to those assigned to the whites, and that if anything the colored courts were being better cared for.‖ As with most other implementations of ―separate yet equal,‖ all present knew the General Superintendent's assertion to be patently false but went along with the charade. [...] In 1948, when the Young Progressives of Maryland, a political group of college-aged men and women in Baltimore, joined with the black Baltimore Tennis Club to stage a protest of Druid Hill Park's segregated tennis facilities, cries of communism were immediate. The interracial game was planned and advertised, but stopped by police before any actual play could take place. All of the players were arrested, along with several spectators who were heard to yell, ""This is Nazi Germany! Why can't they play? They're 33 American citizens!"" As they were arrested, the protestors began singing songs like ""America, the Beautiful,"" ""My Country 'Tis of Thee,"" and the Negro National Anthem.",?,,7,39.31526605,-76.64106228,,,,,1943,,Conflict Center,1929-1954,Public Accommodation,,d63b0e,tennis,,sarapatenaude_playing_2011,excerpt,MD,house,medium,,,,,,,,,,"https://maps.google.com/?layer=c&cbll=39.31526605,-76.6410622760667",Madison,,,7/20/2017 12:48pm
