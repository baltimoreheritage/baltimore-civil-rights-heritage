<p>From NHL Study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, states did not have an absolutely free hand in excluding black voters. Two Supreme Court decisions upheld the power of the Federal government to prosecute suffrage violations. In Ex parte Siebold, the Court affirmed the conviction of a state election judge in Maryland who interfered with federal supervisors during an election. In Ex parte Yarbrough, the high tribunal upheld the convictions of nine members of a white terrorist group, the Pop and Go Club, who beat a black man at his home to prevent him from casting his ballot in a congressional election in Georgia.30 Speaking for the unanimous Court, Justice Samuel Miller eloquently argued: “If the government of the United States has within its constitutional domain no authority to provide against these evils . . . then, indeed, is the country in danger, and its best powers, its highest purposes, the hopes which it inspires, and the love which enshrines it, are at the mercy of the combinations of those who respect no right but brute force on the one hand, and unprincipled corrruptionists on the other.” (Ex parte Yarbrough, 667; Nieman, Promises, 99.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conventions expressing similar sentiments occurred in Augusta, Georgia; Lexington, Kentucky; Little Rock, Arkansas; Mobile, Alabama; and Washington, D.C. As with all the other gatherings, the church played an enormous role in political mobilization. For example, on January 30, 1866, the National Convention of Colored Men met at the Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., with the Reverend Henry Highland Garnet presiding. Delegates assembled from Alabama, the District of Columbia, Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and six New England states. The convention endorsed “the right of impartial suffrage” and sent a delegation, headed by the ex-slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, to meet with President Andrew Johnson, who had succeeded Lincoln. On February 6, 1866, the black emissaries declared to the president that African Americans deserved the suffrage because of the fact that “we are subjects of the Government and subject to taxation, to volunteer in the service of the country, subject to being drafted, subject to bear the burdens of the State, makes it not improper that we should ask in the privileges of this condition.” However, Johnson refused to be swayed. A Tennessee Democrat who opposed slavery not out of any moral consideration for African Americans but on the grounds that it held poor whites under the yoke of elite planters, Johnson had a very dim and racist view of African American capabilities for citizenship. He informed Douglass that granting blacks the franchise would result in “great injury to the white as well as the colored man.” Douglass disparaged the chief executive’s opinion as “unsound and prejudicial.”</p>

<p>From NHL Study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The right to vote has held a central place in the black freedom struggle. With abolition of slavery, African Americans sought the ballot as a means to claim their first-class citizenship. When emancipated blacks pursued equality, they demanded the franchise on the same basis as that exercised by whites. Indeed, when Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic Gettysburg Address in 1863, universal white manhood suffrage existed in the North and the South. Democratic reforms over the previous half-century had whittled down property qualifications that excluded working class and poor white Americans from voting. Once slaves obtained freedom with passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, they intended to participate actively in the political process and help advance their interests. Before emancipation, blacks residing in five New England states could vote. Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which contained only 6 percent of the northern black population, had extended the right to vote to blacks. In New York, blacks owning $250 in freehold property could also cast a ballot; however, the same property qualification did not apply to whites. In the South, where the overwhelming number of African Americans labored as slaves, the right to vote was limited to whites.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2007"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>

<h2 id="decisions-from-kentucky-louisiana">1876: Decisions from Kentucky, Louisiana</h2>
<p><em>United States v. Reese</em>, 92 U.S. 214 (1876), Kentucky</p>
<p>This was the Supreme Court’s first voting rights case heard under the Fifteenth Amendment that prohibited racial discrimination in voting rights and the Enforcement Act of 1870 that required elections be conducted without regard to race. In this case, a voting official was indicted for not casting a black man’s vote in a municipal election.  The Court found that the Fifteenth Amendment did not confer the right to vote. This ruling gave states the ability to use tests to exclude African Americans from voting.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2007"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
<p><em>United States v. Cruikshank</em>, 92 U.S. 542 (1876), Louisiana</p>
<p>Decided the same day as <em>United States v. Reese </em>(above), the Supreme Court ruled that the Justice Department could not use the Enforcement Act to prosecute private individuals for civil rights violations. Thus, the Federal government could only prosecute state officials. This case arose from the Colfax Massacre of 1873 when an armed white force killed African Americans at the Colfax Courthouse and the surrounding square over a contested gubernatorial election. “The <em>Cruikshank</em> opinion encouraged violence in the Reconstruction South and is one of several Supreme Court decisions that marked the nation’s retreat from Reconstruction.” (Hall, 209)<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2007"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>

<p>This case held that encroaching on the voting rights of blacks violated the Fifteenth Amendment. The case arose after eight Ku Klux Klansmen beat a black man at his home for trying to vote in a federal congressional election. This decision was “exceptional in its time” as the one moment in Reconstruction when “the Supreme Court upheld federal power to punish private obstruction of someone’s voting rights.” (Hall, 946-47).<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2007"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>

<h2 id="republican-lloyd-lowndes-elected-governor-in-maryland">1895: Republican Lloyd Lowndes elected governor in Maryland</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The crisis began in 1895 when Republican Lloyd Lowndes carried Baltimore by over 11,000 votes and won the gubernatorial election, and when reform Republican Alcaeus Hooper became mayor of Baltimore. After this, the Democrats’ campaigns became more racist and efforts to disenfranchise blacks increased. In Baltimore City, for example, one of the displays carried in a torch-lit parade was a transparency depicting a black teacher, in an integrated classroom, flogging a white child.8 In this year Dr. John Marcus Cargill was first elected to the City Council, continuing to campaign in the face of unhidden Democratic appeals to racist sentiment. The Democratic-controlled state legislature then passed a series of laws to inhibit black voter participation. In 1904, they removed all party labels from the ballot.&quot; But that still did not prevent blacks from voting. Then, three separate disenfranchisement amendments were passed by the state legislature in 1904, 1908, and 1910.12 They used the devices of literacy clauses, grandfather clauses, and property requirements to reduce the number of black voters. All three amendments were defeated in the required referendum by an interesting combination of voters not present in such large numbers in most southern states where blacks were disenfranchised. Working against the amendments were: all blacks; most white Republicans; leaders of local reform movements, both Republican and Democratic, who sought to keep power out of the hands of the Democratic-controlled machine; and many immigrants and their leaders, sometimes even those allied with the machine, who feared that literacy tests and the grandfather clause would take away their political power as well as that of blacks.</p>

<p>In <em>Williams</em>, the Supreme Court validated Mississippi’s literacy test and found it lawful under the Fifteenth Amendment.  The Court ruled that the literacy test was written in a manner that did not discriminate on the basis of race, and consequently the tests themselves served as a legitimate means of discerning voter eligibility. (Not a voting rights case, this case arose when a black man, convicted of murder, claimed violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because blacks were excluded from juries since none could serve due to exclusionary tests and devices.)<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2007"><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>

<h1 id="section-3">1905 – 1929</h1>
<p>From NHL Study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The combination of poll taxes, secret ballots, literacy/understanding tests, grandfather clauses, and the biased manipulation of these registration procedures achieved the goal of disfranchising the overwhelming number of African Americans. Once Louisiana adopted its new constitution in 1898, the number of black voters plummeted from 130,000 to 5,000. In Virginia, the number dropped from 147,000 to 21,000. The Constitutional Convention in Mississippi cut black enrollment from approximately 147,000 to around 8,600. In 1906, five years after Alabama designed its exclusionary suffrage proposals, only 2 percent of the black voting-age population remained on the registration books.40 The last black congressman from the South until the early 1970s, George H. White of North Carolina, departed the House in 1901.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2007"><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The relatively few black southerners who still could vote encountered a final hurdle in making their ballots count: the white Democratic Party primary. Once upper-class whites managed to snuff out the biracial political threat posed by the Populists, the Democratic Party again reigned supreme. Although Republicans continued to exist, and indeed blacks operated within their ranks, they posed little danger for the reunited Democrats. The class struggle that had divided wealthy and poor whites and that occasioned third parties persisted mainly within the confines of the Democratic Party. To exclude blacks from exercising renewed political leverage, white Democratic officials closed their doors to African Americans. By excluding blacks from their primaries, they stopped African Americans from voting in the sole contest that counted in the one-party Democratic South. Without the white primary, a progressive North Carolina newspaper editor explained, “the divisions among white men might result in bringing about a return to deplorable conditions when one faction of white men called upon the negroes to help defeat another faction.”<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2007"><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></span>   ## 1907: Cummings and campaigning</p>

<h1 id="section-6">1929-1954</h1>
<p>From NHL Study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As it did for so many aspects of civil rights, World War II boosted opportunities for expanding black suffrage. The democratic, anti-racist ideology of the war against Fascism abroad prompted blacks to pursue a “Double V” campaign for victory both abroad and over white supremacy at home. The participation of black troops on the ground, albeit in segregated units, as well as the heroic combat record of the Tuskegee Airmen, the specially trained unit of black pilots, provided palpable arguments for extending full citizenship rights to African Americans. Although the war heightened black expectations of securing the right to vote, it did not guarantee that a half- century of disenfranchisement would end. Fulfilling the promises of the Fifteenth Amendment would take more than wartime rhetoric to achieve; it would require litigation, lobbying, and direct action. Even then, it would take another twenty years after the end of World War II before the majority of black southerners obtained the right to vote.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2007"><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p>

<p>In a case presented by the NAACP, the Supreme Court reversed its decision in <em>Grovey</em> (above) and found the white primary unconstitutional.  “Constitutional scholars cite <em>Allwright</em> as one of the seminal cases in the development of the ‘public function’ concept.” After <em>Allwright</em>, cases concentrated on individual rights to vote, as opposed to group rights, through literacy tests and poll taxes.  (Hall, 800)<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2007"><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>

<p>A federal district court restricted voter registrars from using a literacy test to arbitrarily discriminate against blacks.  The decision was sustained by the U.S. Supreme Court.  (Luker, 70)<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2007"><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span></p>

<p>The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Georgia’s county unit system of voting. In statewide elections, this system gave an advantage to voters in the state’s many small rural counties and was disadvantageous to voters in the fewer urban counties where African Americans were more likely registered to vote. The Court overturned this decision in 1962 and 1964.  (See _Baker v. Carr _and _Reynolds v.

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court found unconstitutional an Alabama statute that redrew the city boundaries of Tuskegee with the effect of excluding almost all of the city’s four hundred black voters, but none of its white voters.  The case “[s]et a precedent for Federal judicial intervention in state redistricting and for later one-person, one-vote decisions that would affect legislative apportionments across the country.” The issue was taken up more directly in <em>Reynolds </em>(1964, below).

<p><em>South Carolina v.

Virginia Board of Elections</em>, 383 U.S. 663 (1966), Virginia The Supreme Court found the state’s poll tax unconstitutional in state and local elections. This ruling’s impact was limited since only three other states used poll taxes (Alabama, Texas, and Mississippi).  (Hall, 366)   <em>Katzenbach v.

<blockquote>
<p>In 1971, an African American, George Russell, the incumbent city solicitor and a former state trial judge, challenged William Donald Schaefer, the powerful former president of the City Council, for the Democratic nomination. Russell built a multicultural coalition and had solid support amongst older, middle-class black Baltimoreans. However, Clarence Mitchell III, an incumbent state senator and scion of the Jackson-Mitchell clan, soon entered the race, and garnered the support of younger African Americans. His entrance effectively split the black vote, allowing Schafer to become mayor, beginning a long reign that did not end until he retired in 1986.633 Disappointed but not defeated, African Americans’ attempts to acquire other important city administration positions began that same year and were successful with the appointment of Roland Patterson as school superintendent in 1971. Three black Baltimoreans were later appointed to the school board in 1975, along with a new African American superintendent, John L. Crew. These victories gave African Americans a majority on the school board for the first time in history.</p>
