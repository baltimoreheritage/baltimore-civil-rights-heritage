        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Great Depression began with the Black Tuesday stock market crash on on October 29, 1929. For Black Baltimoreans, already burdened by employment discrimination and segregated housing, the national economic crisis brought widespread job loss and even deeper poverty.<!-- NOTE: Get some numbers on poverty in this period. --> Decades of legal and political advocacy by the Brotherhood of Liberty, the NAACP, and local coalitions had prevented the mass disenfranchisement found in other Southern towns and cities but segregation and discrimination made life difficult Black Baltimoreans.<!-- Add some figures from the Urban League report?--> “Baltimore is a border city with Southern feelings” observed the <em>Baltimore Afro-American</em> in 1933.<span class="citation" data-cites="ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> At the outset of the Great Depression and through the beginning of World War II, Black residents, joined by some white supporters, responded to these challenges with a renewed campaign of protests, fighting for fair administration criminal justice, equal employment, and equal access to education.</p>
<p>Young people played an important role in renewing the local Civil Rights movement in the 1930s. In October 1931, two sisters, eighteen-year-old Juanita and twenty-year-old Virginia Jackson, responded to the shortage of jobs for Black young people by organizing the City-Wide Young People’s Forum at Sharp Street Church. Activist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nannie_Helen_Burroughs">Nannie Helen Burroughs</a> (1879–1961) later described the group as: “the best, most progressive, and analytical organization of Negro young people in America. It feels, thinks, believes, acts.”<span class="citation" data-cites="ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> Leveraging on the popularity of the group’s regular meetings, in September 1933, Juanita and Virginia’s mother, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillie_Mae_Carroll_Jackson">Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson</a> worked with twenty-five-year-old lawyer Thurgood Marshall, and others to recruit hundreds of young people to picket businesses on Pennsylvania Avenue that refused to hire Black workers. While courts and business-owners ultimately frustrated the success of the “Buy Where You Can Work,” the effort drew the elder Jackson to become the president of the local NAACP in 1935—a position she held up through 1970.<span class="citation" data-cites="SkotnesBuyWhereYou1994"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Around the same time, a series of brutal incidents pushed resident towards more militant activism. The controversial trial and execution of Euel Lee in 1932 and 1933 led to rising protests over inequitable sentencing and inadequacy of protection for Black defendants. The brutal lynching of George Armwood on October 18, 1933, after he was removed from the City Jail and transported back to Princess Anne on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, shocked the conscience of many liberal white Marylanders and galvanized Black support for proposed anti-lynching legislation. <!-- NOTE: Consider adding reference to light sentence for Harry Paterson in Baltimore County.[@BaltimoreFolkExpected1933] --> White Communists were among the most visible white allies of the Civil Rights movement at the time, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labor_Defense">International Labor Defense</a>, a legal advocacy organization associated with the Communist International, and attorney Bernard Ades took on a prominent role in Lee’s defense and in anti-lynching activism in the early 1930s.<span class="citation" data-cites="INTERRACIALGROUPDEMANDS1933 ExclusiveAfroCoverage1933 INTERRACIALGROUPRAPS1933 SkotnesNewDealAll2012"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span><!-- Skotnes has a lot more on this. --></p>
<p>By the beginning of World War II, high rents for overcrowded houses and brutal unjust policing in the city’s segregated Black neighborhoods pushed residents to take even greater risks in pushing for change. After a Baltimore City police officer shot and killed Thomas Broadus, a black U.S. Army private from Pittsburgh, the Citizen’s Committee for Justice a coalition of local activists, chaired by <em>Afro</em> editor Charles Murphy, and including Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson, and Dr. John E.T. Camper, a physician and activist, organized a March on Annapolis. On April 24, 1942, over two thousand Baltimoreans rode charter buses, shared cars for the drive, and even walked to the State House in Annapolis for a hearing with the Governor. It was the largest Civil Rights demonstration in Maryland history and won the creation of a new state commission that promised to address their concerns over police brutality and racial discrimination.<!-- What did the state commission promise? See 1942-protest-notes.md for more details. --></p>
<p>The unprecedented display of political power drew on a dense network of relationships between supporters and activists, largely living in the segregated Black neighborhoods of West Baltimore. Dr. John E.T. Camper lived at 639 N. Carey Street, just a few blocks from Juanita Jackson and Clarence Mitchell (who married in 1938) at Druid Hill Avenue, and Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson.<!-- NOTE: When did Jackson move to Eutaw Place? Look for more names and addresses based on the 1942 protest notes. --><!-- NOTE: When did Charles Murphy move to Morgan Park? --></p>
<p>The beginning of the war created other opportunities for change. <!-- NOTE: What year? Can we better summarize the impact of World War II here? -->As editor of the <em>Afro</em>, Charles Murphy joined other Black newspaper editors and activists in pushing the “Double V” campaign seeking victory over fascism in Europe and victory over injustice at home in the United States. The paper labeled support for segregation and discrimination as “Hitlerism” in their fight to influence public opinion. In 1941, President Roosevelt’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_8802">executive order</a> prohibiting discrimination in the defense industry established the Fair Employment Practices Commission and thirty-year-old Clarence Mitchell (who had reported on Armwood’s lynching for the <em>Afro</em> in 1934) joined the new commission as the associate director of field operations. The FEPC sought to support Black workers as they fought discriminatory hiring and management practices by industrial employers in Baltimore and around the country. Liberal Republican Theodore McKeldin won office as Mayor in November 1942 (serving from 1943 to 1947) thanks to Black voters and extensive voter registration efforts by the NAACP in the early 1940s.<!--Check this.--></p>
<p>After the war ended in 1945, Black residents began buying homes in formerly segregated white neighborhoods west of Fulton Avenue. Crowding in segregated Black neighborhoods made Black households willing to risk the violence or antagonism of white neighbors, in order to purchase a home for their family.<!-- NOTE: Citation missing. Also insert a sentence aobut the 1948 Supreme Court decision overturning the legality of racial covenants. --> The pattern of neighborhood change accelerated after the Supreme Court ruled that racial covenants were unconstitutional in 1948 and, even more so following the 1954 <em>Brown v. Board</em> decision. At the same time, builders began to put up huge numbers of new homes in Baltimore County with support from the Federal Housing Administration. <!-- NOTE: Incorporate notes from Hirsch on the federal role for housing in this period. --> The move into new neighborhoods reflected not only necessity, however, but also the rising aspirations and expectations of many African Americans after World War II.<!-- NOTE: Rewrite this section. --></p>
<p>A few white elected officials offered at least limited support for those Black Marylanders demanding the fair treatment by the state government, including the desegregation of public space and public institutions. As Governor from 1951 to 1959, Theodore McKeldin delivered incremental change: ending segregation at all state parks in 1953 and at public pools and beaches in 1955. <!-- NOTE: Citation missing. --> In 1951, the Maryland legislature finally changed state laws that had required racial segregation on trains and boats. Another example is found at Ford’s Theatre on Fayette Street, where student protests against racially segregated seating began in 1948. Five years of pickets organized by the NAACP, boycotts, and pressure from Governor McKeldin finally forced the desegregation of the prominent downtown Baltimore theatre in 1953.<!-- NOTE: Citation missing. --> The Baltimore Urban League provided another vehicle for interracial activism by avoiding protest in favor of negotiating directly with local businesses and segregated union locals to change discriminatory practices. For example, in 1951, the Urban League worked with the Yellow Cab Company and the AFL Taxicab Operators Union to begin hiring Black drivers and, in the spring of 1952, with the Baltimore Transit Company and AFL Transit Workers Union to begin hiring Black bus drivers and streetcar operators.<span class="citation" data-cites="CannonEFFORTHIRINGNEGROES1953"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span><!-- What about integration of Baltimore Polytechnic> --></p>
<p>Young activists continued to push the pace and goals of the local and national Civil Rights movements.<!-- NOTE: Insert mention of the Druid Hill Park protest in 1948? --> Members of the local chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality or CORE (an interracial organization established in Chicago in 1942) continued to push changes at local businesses around downtown Baltimore. Between 1953 and 1955, students from Morgan State University joined members of CORE on the 200 block of W. Lexington Street for a series of nonviolent sit-in protests against discrimination against Black diners at “five-and-dime” lunch counters.<!-- Mention the role of local and national chains in extending small wins into big wins. Add a mention of CORE distributing this as a case study and possibly inspiring the Woolworth sit-in. --> <!-- Mention role of Cold War politics in changing segregation policy? Who pushed the Maryland legislature to change in 1951? --></p>
<p>The gathering momentum and urgency of the Civil Rights movement following the Supreme Court decision in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> also helped activists win federal changes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957">Civil Rights Act of 1957</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1960">Civil Rights Act of 1960</a>. The 1957 legislation, signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, was the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction, created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Commission_on_Civil_Rights">U.S. Commission on Civil Rights</a>. The Commission—though initially limited to fact-finding—played a key role in documenting injustice. Congress granted the Commission expanded authority under the 1964 Civil Rights legislation. Women also won new protections with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Pay_Act_of_1963">Equal Pay Act of 1963</a> and new protections against gender discrimination in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>.</p>
<p>While the significance of the <em>Brown</em> decision in undermining the legal basis for segregated public life was increasingly clear, many white Marylanders were intransigent in their support for segregation. In 1960, student activists with Baltimore’s Civic Interest Group (CIG) led the push for desegregation at downtown department stores and restaurants on Howard Street including Hutzler’s, Stewart’s, and Hoschild-Kohn’s. The next year, in 1961, after embarrassing incidents of discrimination against African diplomats at restaurants along U.S. Route 40 in Maryland and Delaware<!--Where?-->, CORE activists saw an opportunity to push for broader change. CORE recruited volunteers from CIG and several other organizations for the “Route 40 Project” to challenge the segregated facilities in a massive Freedom Ride on November 11. Just days before the ride began, however, forty-seven restaurants along Route 40 agreed to desegregate thanks to the activists and pressure from the Kennedy administration.

<p>While some white Baltimoreans sought to promote integrated neighborhoods through groups like Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. (founded in 1959 by James Rouse, Ellsworth Rosen, and Sidney Hollander, Jr.), many more relocated to the segregated white communities in the suburbs. As thousands of white residents left the city for federally subsidized suburban developments the population of Baltimore County more than tripled between 1940 and 1960. The expansion of highways, including the Jones Falls Expressway (I-83), the planning of the Franklin-Mulberry Expressway, and the Baltimore Beltway (I-695) which opened in stages between 1955 and 1962, made it easier for white commuters to move away.<!-- Citation missing. --> In 1958, the Maryland State Commission on Interracial Problems compared Baltimore to cities like Detroit or Chicago (where violent attacks on new Black neighbors notoriously frequent) and observed that Baltimore’s problem “is not with violence but with the frigid withdrawal” of white residents.<span class="citation" data-cites="OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994"><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> Moreover, Black Baltimoreans were excluded from the suburban migration by mortgage discrimination by private banks and the Federal Housing Administration and exclusionary zoning policies.<span class="citation" data-cites="McdougallBlackBaltimoreNew1993"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span><!-- NOTE: Add citations. --></p>

The fact is that while we have moved, we have not moved toward the solution of these problems with the speed and vigor with which we are capable. We have not really attempted, as a community, to understand the plight, the unrest, and the feelings of those who have been denied.

<p>Thirty-five years after the Young People’s Forum began, twenty-four years after the consequential March on Annapolis, and twelve years after the <em>Brown</em> decision, Black people in Baltimore continued to struggle against white resistance and racist policies, against employment discrimination, segregated and inadequate housing, unequal educational opportunities, and racist policing. The contradiction between the apparent success of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore and Maryland with the continued challenges facing Baltimore’s black residents again drew the attention of national activists such as Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and CORE with their designation of Baltimore as a “Target City” that summer.<!-- NOTE: What was I think about in the reference to Martin Luther King?

<p>In the next section, the study highlights some of the places associated with the Civil Rights movement in this period. The study continues to describe four key themes in detail:<!-- Update these summaries for the expanded time period. --></p>
<ul>
<li>Politics?</li>
<li><strong>Housing</strong>: A severe shortage of housing created difficult conditions for thousands of black Baltimoreans. This issue framed the struggle to build public housing for African Americans and pursue opportunities to purchase homes in formerly segregated white neighborhoods after World War II.</li>
<li><strong>Education</strong>: As the NAACP continued to campaign against segregated schools locally and nationally, black educators and administrators continued to build on the 1921 Strayer Report to improve conditions for Baltimore’s black students.</li>
<li><strong>Employment</strong>: Black workers also sought better conditions and more job opportunities and found a partner in the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).</li>
<li><strong>Public Accommodations</strong>: White allies and African American students served as key supporters for activist efforts that opened public parks and recreational facilities, along with some (but not all) shops, restaurants, and theaters by the early 1950s.</li>
<li><strong>Criminal Injustice</strong>: Baltimore activists participated in national anti-lynching advocacy and fought police and mob violence in Baltimore. Activist efforts led to the city’s first black uniformed police officers following the 1942 March on Annapolis.</li>

<p>These included the Smith Hotel described by the <em>Sun</em>, at the time of the demolition in July 1957, as “almost a shrine to much of Baltimore’s Negro population.” The hotel was built in 1912 by Thomas R.

<p>Electoral politics also reemerged as a major source of opportunity for change. A few months before the 1932 election, the Afro-American helped to organize a registration drive for black voters, highlighting the fact that in Baltimore City, “37,908 colored people are registered and ready to vote, and 54,000 of us are slackers and ineligible to cast a ballot because we have not registered.”<span class="citation" data-cites="GiveBaltimoreNew1932"><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>

<p>In 1943, the same voters helped to defeat long-serving Democratic Mayor Howard W. Jackson in favor of Republican Theodore McKeldin. McKeldin’s liberal views on civil rights won him significant support from black voters who including many registered by the NAACP in the group’s “Vote for Victory” drive.<span class="citation" data-cites="MinistersUrgeNew1943"><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span> Reverend Marion Bascom, a Civil Rights activist and leader of Douglas Memorial Community Church, later reflected on how as Mayor and later Governor Theodore McKeldin was accessible to activists:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Support for Nice and McKeldin did not reverse the major realignment of black voters from the Republican to the Democratic Party. Black voters in northern cities were key to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s reelection in 1936.<span class="citation" data-cites="SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009"><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></span><!--This source is focused on 1936--> The election marked the political debut of the CIO in promoting voter turnout around the country.

<p>The Colored Women’s Democratic Campaign Committee organized by Victorine Q. Adams (1912–2006) in December 1946 and regular voter registration campaigns by the NAACP in the 1940s, led directly to the election of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_A._Cole">Harry A. Cole</a> to the Maryland State Senate in 1954 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verda_Welcome">Verda Welcome</a> in 1962. Cole was first African American ever elected to the Maryland Senate and Welcome was the first black woman to be elected to any state senate in the country—key victories for African Americans seeking change through representation in local and state government. However, these victories also reflected a city where African Americans made up a growing share of the electorate as white residents fled to the suburbs.</p>
<h3 id="interracial-activism">Interracial activism</h3>
<p>Finally, spaces for organizing, community building, and mutual support continued to be an important resource for both white and black activists. One example is Levering Hall at the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University. In 1953, Chester Wickwire accepted a position as the executive secretary of the campus YMCA and the chaplain for the university. At Levering Hall, Wickwire provided “a haven for liberals on an otherwise conservative campus” and ran “ran various student life programs such as concerts, dances, and movie screenings while simultaneously organizing political discussions about civil rights, pacifism, the Cold War, and Vietnam.” Wickwire himself was an active participant in the Civil Rights movement and helped support student activists.<!-- Citation missing!

<h3 id="white-reaction-in-politics">White reaction in politics</h3>
<p>Between 1950 and 1960, the population of Baltimore County grew by over 80% (from 270,273 to 492,428). In the same ten year period, Baltimore City lost population (dropping from 949,708 to 939,024) while the proportion of African American residents grew (23.70% to 34.67%). Between 1960 and 1970, the population of Baltimore County continue to grow (26.12% to 621,077). Between 1950 and 1970, the population of Anne Arundel County, the population grew by more than 250% (117,392 in 1950 to 206,634 in 1960 to 297,539 in 1970).</p>
<p>Racialized suburban growth, or “white flight”, functioned as an implicit strategy of white resistance to integration. White resistance also included more explicit and, at times, violent responses by white people who sought to maintain the status quo and supported elected officials who ran on their opposition to the Civil Rights movement. White Baltimoreans in the city and suburbs voted in support of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace">George C. Wallace</a> (the segregationist Democratic Governor of Alabama) in the 1964 Democratic primary and for Barry Goldwater (a Republican Senator and opponent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) in that year’s general election.</p>
<h2 id="housing">Housing</h2>
<p>The New Deal and World War II both led to major changes in the relationship of the city and state government to housing and transportation in Baltimore. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the racial transition of Baltimore central neighborhoods continued as it had intermittently for decades prior. In East Baltimore, African American congregations moved into buildings formerly occupied by white churches as, in 1929, the Episcopalian Church of the Holy Innocents sold their building to Grace Baptist Church and, in 1931, Baltimore’s oldest Black Roman Catholic congregation—St. Francis Xavier—purchased the Madison Square M.E. Church.<span class="citation" data-cites="HaywardOldEastBaltimore2005"><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p>
<p>During the Great Depression, the shortage of new homes for both white and black buyers kept existing homeowners fixed in place and slowed the process of racial transition that had been underway in west and east Baltimore neighborhoods from the 1880s through the 1920s.</p>
<p>The lines of segregation were further reinforced by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) (established in 1933) which used infamous “red-lining” maps to discourage lending in neighborhoods where African Americans lived. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Housing_Act_of_1934">National Housing Act of 1934</a> created the Federal Housing Administration and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_Act_of_1937">Housing Act of 1937</a> provided a new source of federal funding for cities like Baltimore to engage in “slum clearance” and build new public housing projects. The federal government continued to shape housing policy after WWII with the approval of the Housing Act of 1949 on July 15, 1949.</p>
<p>These policy changes, and the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_v._Kraemer">Shelley v. Kraemer</a></em> ending the legal enforcement of racial covenants shaped changes in the areas of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public housing beginning in the late 1930s</li>
<li>Private housing beginning in the mid-1940s through racial transition and “white flight”</li>
<li>Transportation and land use policies that had a discriminatory affect on black neighborhoods</li>
</ul>
<p>Across the country, housing starts dropped by over 90% from a high of 937,000 in 1925 to 93,000 in 1933.<span class="citation" data-cites="HaywardBaltimoreRowhouse2001"><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p>
<p>During the Great Depression, West Baltimore’s “color line” had stabilized around Fulton Avenue. Beginning in the late 1940s, however, neighborhoods at the edge of Old West Baltimore began to transition from white to black. The change was driven by a number of factors including the rapid growth of Baltimore’s African American population during the 1940s and 1950s, the intense overcrowding and deteriorating housing conditions within historically segregated African American neighborhoods, and the movement of white households out of the center city to the areas of new development in the Baltimore suburbs.</p>
<p>From January 1941 to November 1941 alone, housing vacancies for units open to African American occupancy shrank from .8% to .1%. In a letter to Mayor McKeldin in July 1945, in response to the efforts by a group of 350 residents in the Fulton Avenue area to prevent black residents from moving west, the NAACP argued “growth demands that we take in those streets that fringe our area since every attempt to enter new sections is vigorously denied.” The Citizens Committee for Justice and the Baltimore Urban League observed “the need for more housing is most sharply felt in the Negro community, where there are virtually no vacancies of any type.”<span class="citation" data-cites="MayorDiscussesNegro1945"><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>
<p>An October 1948 editorial in the Baltimore Sun described the “colored section of most cities” as “already dangerously overcrowded” and noted that only 2% of new housing built in 1948 was open to African Americans, despite representing 20% of Baltimore’s total population.<span class="citation" data-cites="SmallProportionNew1948"><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></span> By 1950, Baltimore had 226,053 black residents, representing 23.8% of the population but occupying only 19.4% of dwelling units. This pattern continued into the early 1950s: of the 53,000 permits issued new homes in Baltimore metropolitan area from 1950 to 1953, only 3,200 of those were open to African American households, even as the black population increased another 10%.<!-- Citation missing! --></p>
<p>While after WWII, the federal government began to profess support for Black Americans struggling with housing but substantive policy changes were missing. For example, Clarence Mitchell praised Albert Cole, Administrator of the HHFA for his “fine words” at an event in Detroit but noted that Cole avoided “the basic problem.” Mitchell predicted “we shall continue to have the Levittown, Birmingham, and Baltimore type of problem,” officially sanctioned residential segregation, until the federal government adopted a “flat policy” of non-discrimination.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hirschlastmostdifficult2005"><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 id="racial-transition-and-white-flight">Racial transition and “white flight”</h3>
<p>When African American residents began responding to this housing crisis by purchasing homes in formerly segregated white neighborhoods some white resident met them with violence. In 1945, a group of people, described by the <em>Baltimore Afro American</em> as “hoodlums who resented having the Millers move into a white neighborhood,” threw bricks at the home of James Miller and his family at 816 N. Fulton Avenue, breaking glass in the front door and windows.<span class="citation" data-cites="FultonAvenueHome1945"><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></span> The newspaper expanded on this account writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of at least fifty houses on Fulton Avenue now owned by colored persons between the 500 and 1800 blocks, only one case of violence has been reported by one of the three families now known to occupy homes there. The James Miller family, which moved into 816 N. Fulton Avenue on February 15, reported that bricks were thrown through a window and door panel on the following Saturday. The second floor of this house is occupied by the William Montgomery family… Among Fulton Avenue property owners are the Rev. Hiram J. Smith, Dr. Bruce Alleyne and the Medicos Club, an organization of physicians and dentists. “For Sale” signs may be seen all along Fulton Avenue.<span class="citation" data-cites="50HomesOwned1945"><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In August 1948, a house on the 1300 block of Payson Street just to the north of the district was subject to an arson attempt, attributed to retaliation against a white Jewish home-owner who had “broken” the block by selling a property to an African American homeowner in 1946.<span class="citation" data-cites="RacialHatredBlamed1948"><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span> In July 1950 after Ms. Beatrice Sessoms, a native of North Carolina who came to Baltimore two years earlier, moved with her nephew to the 2300 block of Lauretta Avenue, her house was attacked.<span class="citation" data-cites="HomeBuyerStanding1950"><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></span> Dr. Ed Orser quotes one black West Baltimore resident recalling the experience of white flight in the late 1940s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Black people started moving out of the confined areas somewhere around 1947 or 1948, but what would happen was that whites would evacuate a block or two blocks, and black people would move in. The evacuation would take place first. I remember streets like Fulton Avenue, Monroe Street—they were once totally white, and they went through the transition and changed somewhere between 1946 and 1949—that was the time I was in service. When I went in, there were no black people when I came out, there they were black streets… But it wasn’t integration… it was an evacuation.<span class="citation" data-cites="OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994"><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These initial movements soon accelerated, particularly in west and northwest areas of Baltimore. Lula Jones Garrett, a columnist for the <em>Baltimore Afro</em>, observed in a column titled “Change-the-Address New Game on Baltimore Front” writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What with the local yokels forsaking the ghettos and moving into swankier mansions, it takes a special edition of the directory to locate your best friends these days.“<span class="citation" data-cites="GarrettChangetheAddressNewGame1949"><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The process of this rapid transition is closely associated with negative accounts of realtors or “block-busters” using a range of tactics to take advantage of both white sellers and black buyers. For example, during the 1940s and 1950s many African American households purchased home under land-installment contracts or buy-like-rent arrangements, also known as lease option contracts, that allowed home-owners to purchase property without an initial down payment or closing charges. However, these arrangements did not immediately transfer title to the property and the contract could still be terminated if the new home-owner missed a single payment. Although the black home-ownership rate rose by 194% between 1940 and 1950, in comparison to 58.8% for whites, a 1955 survey by the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations found that 53% of their respondents had purchased their homes through such arrangements rather than regular financing.<span class="citation" data-cites="OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994"><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></span> <!-- This citation doesn't include the increase in homeownership rates although it may be on another page of Orser. --></p>
<p>According to an interview with Antero Pietella, in 1947, Thomas Cripps witnessed a man with suit in the area around his home at 2323 Mosher Street carrying signs “This House is Not for Sale,” with the implication that the neighborhood was imminently threatened with transition. Cripps’ family became the first household on the block to sell their property to a black family when they sold their home in 1949 to Ellsworth F. Davage, a Baltimore County school teacher, and his wife Elizabeth.<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010"><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Although Baltimore evidently avoided widespread physical violence on a scale comparable to white antagonists in Detroit or Chicago, the State Commission on Interracial Problems observed in 1958, “The problem it said, is not with violence ‘but with the frigid withdrawal’ of whites from the Negroes.” During the late 1950s, the State Commission and others finally engaged with the ongoing process of racial transition with the beginning of advocacy and organizing efforts to promote “neighborhood stabilization.”<span class="citation" data-cites="NEGROGAINSSEEN1958"><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></span></p>

<p>The issue reached Edmondson Village around 1955, when the first black residents moved west of the Gwynns Falls to live in the southeast corner of the region, around the western end of the Baltimore Street Bridge. One white resident remarked on the experience, commenting to Dr. Ed Orser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the [black] people started moving into the neighborhood, they did come in, literally block by block. I can recall when they came across the… bridge, everybody was very upset; they said, “Oh my God, they’re over the bridge now; our street will be next.”<span class="citation" data-cites="OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994"><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></span><!-- Missing page number --></p>

<p>In April 1958, the improvement group organized their annual meeting at School No. 88 located at Wildwood Parkway and Gelston Drive, hosting Chief Judge Delany Foster of the Orphans Court of Baltimore as the guest speaker. In July 1958, Association president L.E. Larsen gave the association’s support to a plan sponsored by the Baltimore Urban League, the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations, and the Citizens Planning and Housing Association to “combat the conversion of Baltimore areas from all-white to all-Negro occupancy.” Larsen observed that Edmondson Village:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>already faced with pressure from block-busting realtor tactics and population shifts… the exodus from the city of the stable core of responsible citizens will likely be accelerated and the inevitable consequences will be a set-back to many of the long-range plans now being developed and implemented.<span class="citation" data-cites="POPULATIONSHIFTFOUGHT1958"><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An African American resident in this period later shared her experience in an oral history with Dr. Ed Orser, remarking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we first moved to the neighborhood, it was more white – we were just about the second black family on this block… We could see the changes, because when we moved, there were so many sale signs all around, and it did make a difference in the neighborhood, because there was a change, and you had to get yourself adjusted to the people who were moving in, and you couldn’t really know the ones who were moving out, because they were leaving so fast, so we were really going through a transitional stage. People were moving in and out overnight; you didn’t really know who your neighbors were. It was a difficult period, because when we moved, we thought maybe the neighborhood would be stabilized; it just wasn’t.<span class="citation" data-cites="OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994"><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></span></p>

<p>By 1960, however, the area south of Edmondson Village had changed from more than 99% white in 1950 to 62% black in 1960 and, a decade later, 92% black in 1970. Edmondson Village itself remained 99% white in 1960 but had changed to 97% black by 1970.<span class="citation" data-cites="OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994"><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></span> <!-- Missing page number --></p>

Examples include the construction of the Howard Street extension and bridge over the Jones Falls in 1938 (displacing a large number African American households) and the initial expansion of Druid Lake Drive in 1947 (Druid Lake Drive expanded again in 1964 despite significant opposition from nearby residents).<span class="citation" data-cites="WatmoughHowardStSteel1938 DestructionDruidHill1947"><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></span> In 1948, the NAACP sued to try to stop the conversion of Druid Hill Avenue and McCulloh Street into one-way streets but was unsuccessful in reversing the move.<span class="citation" data-cites="CourtAskedHalt1948"><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The most notable of the proposed road projects in this period was the 1944 plan for an east-west highway prepared by New York planner Robert Moses.

<p>However, the <em>Brown</em> decision pushed these issues to the forefront of the local debate and encouraged the years of activism that followed. The link between the Brown decision and the integration of public facilities stands out clearly in the opinion by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_and_City_Council_of_Baltimore_v._Dawson">Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v.

<blockquote>
<p>it is obvious that racial segregation in recreational activities can no longer be sustained as a proper exercise of the police power of the State; for if that power cannot be invoked to sustain racial segregation in the schools, where attendance is compulsory…it cannot be sustained with respect to public beach and bathhouse facilities, the use of which is entirely optional.<span class="citation" data-cites="Schustercityswingset2011"><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The major areas of activism include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public parks and recreational facilities (such as pools and recreation centers)</li>
<li>Theaters, stores, and other private businesses open to the public</li>
<li>Transportation facilities (passenger railroad and ferries)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="parks-and-recreation">Parks and recreation</h3>
<p>Baltimore’s growing African American population made it more difficult in the 1930s for Baltimore City to sustain segregation for the city’s parks and recreational facilities.<span class="citation" data-cites="KirschMunicipalGolfCivil2007 WellsSeparateEqualDesegregating2008 BaidyaroyBlacksGolfEmerging2011"><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></span></p>
<p>For example, in September 1934, the Carroll Park golf course partly opened to African American golfers but limited black players to specific days maintaining separation from white players through staggered play. In 1938, two black golfers Dallas Nicholas and William I. Gosnell sued Baltimore City to try to overturn this policy but were unsuccessful.<span class="citation" data-cites="WellsSeparateEqualDesegregating2008"><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></span> <!-- TODO: Find more details about this suit. --><!-- Citation missing page number. --></p>
<p>On December 17, 1947, a group of white and black young people organized an integrated youth basketball game at Garrison Junior High School to protest segregationist policies. This pattern of interracial protest continued on July 11, 1948 when a group of young black and white tennis players organized a game on the tennis courts at Druid Hill Park. The protest led to a lawsuit against the city, Boyer v. Garrett (1949), that resulted in the court overturning the city’s long-standing policy of racial segregation in city parks.<span class="citation" data-cites="ChesnutBoyerGarrett1949"><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Emboldened by this success, in 1950, a group of African American activists attempted to purchase tickets for the beach at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Smallwood_Park">Fort Smallwood Park</a> a popular recreational park located in Anne Arundel County but owned and managed by Baltimore City. <!-- TODO: What happened when they tried to buy tickets? --></p>

<h3 id="theaters-and-stores">Theaters and stores</h3>
<p>Many downtown department stores refused to allow black shoppers to try on clothes, return clothes after a purchase, or provide service to black shoppers at all. In addition, store restaurants and lunch counters refused to seat African American diners offering them take out service or no service at all. In 1945, the <em>Afro-American</em> newspaper began the “Orchid and Onion” campaign to celebrate stores that did not discrimination against black shopper (“Orchids”) and shame downtown department stores with discriminatory policies (“Onions”).<span class="citation" data-cites="FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998"><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Black people faced similar policies of separation and discrimination at local theaters as well as stores. In addition, theaters often refused to book black musicians and performers. On February 1, 1948, the Baltimore police arrested a group of Morgan State College students for picketing Ford’s Theater on Fayette Street. The students and other activists soon returned and continued a five year campaign to end segregated seating at Ford’s Theater. Finally, in 1953, Ford’s Theatre ended segregated seating. After the Lyric Theatre on Mt. Royal Avenue refused to allow singer and activist Marian Anderson to perform, Baltimore’s Commission on Human Relations intervened and persuaded the theatre owners to allow Marian Anderson to appear in January 1954. Despite this progress, however, most hotels and restaurants remained segregated so, after the performance, Sidney Hollander, Sr. hosted an afternoon reception with Anderson at his home. <!-- TODO: Where did Sidney Hollander, Sr. live? Bolton Hill or Windsor Hills?--></p>
<!-- Public accommodations section from 1954-1968 -->
<p>The discrimination African Americans faced in public accommodations was not just one of simple exclusion. Historian Paul A. Kramer notes that the discriminatory “racial practices” at Baltimore’s downtown department stores included three main aspects:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Discrimination in employment (only hired as maintenance or stockroom workers, elevator operators, porters, and restroom attendants; not higher-paying, higher-status jobs)</li>
<li>Refusal to serve African American customers at lunch counters</li>
<li>Policies prohibiting African American customers from trying on or returning clothing</li>
</ol>
<p>The prohibition on returns from African American customers (known as the “final sale” policy) reveals one of the fundamental motivation behind racial segregation: “anxieties and fears about physical contact between whites and blacks”. Kramer continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For most whites, blacks represented sources of unspecified physical and moral pollution … Black and white bodies might “touch” in the exchange of forks and plates at store lunch-counters. Even more threatening to whites was the possibility that the clothes they tried on or purchased might bear an invisible taint of black physical contact.<span class="citation" data-cites="KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003"><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notably, in early 1943, when the Baltimore NAACP sought to overturn the state’s Jim Crow laws, the repeal bill they supported was sent to state legislature <em>Hygiene Committee</em> rather than <em>Judiciary Committee</em> for consideration.<span class="citation" data-cites="KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003"><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></span></p>
<p>One early challenge to these segregationist policies came in 1953 with an interracial group of CORE activists using sit-ins to protest segregated lunch counters (a strategy used previously in New York City in 1939 and by other CORE activists in Chicago in 1942). The success of their efforts was noted in the regular column of Mrs. B.M. Phillips (“If You Ask Me”) in the Afro-American Newspaper on November 7, 1953:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the Committee On Racial Equality, (CORE), the Urban league, and the Americans for Democratic Action, (ADA), more stores in the 200 block W. Lexington st. are realizing there is no color line in the dollars you spend. Lunch counters and restaurants in the Kresge and Woolworth Five and Ten have been serving all customers for several weeks. McCrory’s has just reversed its policy and will serve all comers […] Schulte United in the 200 block Lexington is still acting silly.<span class="citation" data-cites="PhillipsIfYouAsk1953"><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The success, however, was limited. One 1955 survey found that 91% of 191 randomly-selected Baltimore businesses reported either the “exclusion” or “segregation” of blacks.<span class="citation" data-cites="KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003"><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></span> The annual report of the Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations also provided updates on discriminatory policies listing “places of public accommodations [that] are open to all” in March 1958.</p>
<p>As Phillips alludes in her column, the issue of public accommodation was often presented in terms of consumer politics. This made the issue personal for middle-class black activists like Mrs. Madeline W. Murphy who wrote to the Vice President of Hoschild Kohn in 1956 to say “not only [do I] feel equal to the average Hochschild Kohn’s consumers but I feel superior to them.” Such emphasis on racial equality as individual access made the desegregation of public accommodations “less of a challenge to traditional notions of racial equality” (in contrast to education, employment, and voting rights) and helped secure the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.<span class="citation" data-cites="SalvatoreCivilRightsAmerica2004"><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></span></p>
<p>CORE’s downtown campaign faded after the successful desegregation of the Read’s Drug Store lunch counter in January 1955. A new movement of students took up the cause on March 26, 1960 when black student activists from Morgan State University attempted to purchase food at department store restaurants at the Northwood Shopping Center and downtown. The student’s tried to purchase lunch at four downtown department stores. The succeeded at Hochschild Kohn; Sewart’s shut their food counters to all customers, white and black; Hutzler’s refused to serve a group of twenty students who waited for three hours before leaving.</p>
<p>The sit-ins continued through April 17, 1960, Easter Sunday when the <em>Sun</em> reported that Albert D. Hutzler met with Furman Templeton from the Urban League, along with activists David Glenn and Robert B. Watts. After the meeting, Hutzler announced: “We have lifted restrictions. Negroes will be served in our restaurants.” Hecht-May and other downtown stores followed Hoschild Kohn and Hutzler’s with the change.</p>
<p>A large collection of letters sent to Hoschild Kohn after their policy change in late March 1960 reflect attitudes to desegregation in the period. Interestingly, there are ten times the number of letters in support of integration but that is likely because activists saw the urgency of continuing the policy and saw integration as “frighteningly reversible.” Some opponents of desegregation described a rationale of “consumer choice”, as one woman wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you realize that by so doing [integrating], you are taking from the White Race any choice they had of segregation or integration when dining outside of their homes?<span class="citation" data-cites="KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003"><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others threatened to stay away from the downtown store, now that the policy of segregation had been abandoned. Paul Kramer notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>more than one of the racist critics wrote as self-conscious suburbanites, warning the downtown that integration would further provoke the flight of white residences and businesses. In the process, they revealed the extent to which the suburbs were imagined as racial islands still free of black “invasion”: downtown segregation was the only remaining draw that could pull whites in from their comfortable, newly-designed racial enclaves.<span class="citation" data-cites="KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003"><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notably, department stores had their own role in the suburban exodus with Hutzler’s stores in Towson (1952), Eastpoint (1956), Westview (1958); and Hoschild Kohn’s in Edmondson Village (1947).<!-- Citation missing! I think this is sourced from Orser. --> Civil Rights supporters also saw the importance of suburbanization in shaping the debate over public accommodation. In August 1957, a column in the <em>Afro</em> noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The big downtown stores and business have not welcomed colored people in the past… Their white only customers have moved to the suburbs and the colored customers they spurned are moving out too. So the heart of the city is no longer Lexington and Howard Sts.<span class="citation" data-cites="PhillipsIfYouAsk1957"><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></span> <!-- FIXME: Double-check the citation above --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around the United States, the push for public accommodations continued in the 1950s, as a 2004 report from the National Historic Landmarks program describes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the 1950s, a number of northern and western states adopted legislation prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations. Joining the eighteen states with such laws already on the books were Oregon (1953), Montana (1955), New Mexico (1955), Vermont (1957), Maine (1957), Idaho (1959), and Alaska (1959). In 1961, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming brought the total number of states with anti-segregations statutes up to twenty-eight. In addition, several cities in states that did not have public accommodations laws passed their own versions, including Wilmington, Delaware; Baltimore, Maryland; St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri; and El Paso, Texas.<span class="citation" data-cites="SalvatoreCivilRightsAmerica2004"><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></span></p>

<p>The win was celebrated at the annual meeting of the national NAACP in Baltimore, in the “midst of presidential election season.” The event attracted more than five hundred delegates, including two hundred youth delegates organized by Juanita Jackson, and, according to Patricia Sullivan “offered a venue for delegates to report on developments in their communities to a nationally representative group; develop contacts; debate, refine, and develop strategies and tactics; and see their efforts within the full context of NAACP activity.”<span class="citation" data-cites="SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009"><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></span> In a speech at the meeting, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Francis_White">Walter Francis White</a>, referenced the recent victory in the <em>Murray</em> case, saying: “If you are willing to struggle with us… who knows but there may be Negroes in the universities of states such as Mississippi and Arkansas?”<span class="citation" data-cites="SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009"><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></span></p>

<!-- This section feels disjointed and thin on details. -->
<p>Unlike many other Southern cities and other jurisdictions in Maryland, the Baltimore City School Board, chaired by Walter Sondheim, responded quickly to the 1954 Supreme Court decision in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v.Board_of_Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a> by announcing a plan to end legal segregation. The city continued the long-standing policy of “open-enrollment” (where any student could attend any school) but dropped the requirement that Black students attend segregated “colored schools.”</p>
<p>After a brief outbreak of unrest at four recently integrated white public schools, representatives of nineteen civic, religious, educational and labor groups came together to form the Coordinating Council for Civic Unity to support the “peaceful opening of schools.” The group, composed largely of white organizations, reportedly “served as an information clearing house and ‘fire brigade’ on the alert for other racial friction.”<span class="citation" data-cites="ParrisBlacksCityHistory1971"><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Standing in contrast to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_resistance">“massive resistance”</a> seen elsewhere in the South, Baltimore’s move won praise at the time, but historian Howard Baum notes the critical flaw in the plan: “Explicitly, [the school board] would not discriminate against black children; implicitly, neither would it act on their behalf.”<span class="citation" data-cites="BaumBrownBaltimore2011"><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></span> For white families, the policy likely “added to racial anxiety”, as Baum notes:</p>

The second was the school district’s transition from majority white to a majority Black student enrollment.<span class="citation" data-cites="BaumBrownBaltimore2011"><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></span> By 1960, a majority of students in Baltimore’s school district were black. One-third of Black students now attended formerly white schools but many students still attended segregated schools.</p>
<p>In 1963, a group of white and Black parents, known as 28 Parents, presented a report to the school board describing how students continued to experience <em>de facto</em> segregation. The activists identified three contributing factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The construction of new schools in racially segregated neighborhoods; making a segregated student population more likely</li>
<li>The preference for enrolling neighborhood children when schools were “overcrowded”; again reinforcing existing patterns of segregation</li>
<li>Administrative actions to discourage integration. Baum notes, “Some white principals encouraged white parents to transfer their children out when black enrollment grew. Some principals reject black transfer applications to predominantly white schools.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Even within integrated schools, “ability tracking” separated black and white students within the building. The 28 Parents report highlighted a disturbing reality for Civil Rights activists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a decade of legal segregation, most children attended class with majorities of their own race… By the time the board ended practices that limited choices, the desegregation policy had a ten-year history associated in the public mind with continuing segregation.“<span class="citation" data-cites="BaumBrownBaltimore2011"><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></span><!-- Is this a quote from Baum or from the 28 Parents report? Citation is confusing. --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Civil_Rights_Act">1964 Civil Rights Act</a> created a federal interest in desegregating schools encouraging the city to take further action. ## Employment</p>
<p>In 1949, the Baltimore City Medical Society, a local professional association for doctors, voted to admit African American members.</p>
<p>From July 14 to July 16 1961, members of the Student Non-Violence Coordinating Committee (including representatives from all sixteen Southern states and Washington, D.C.) met at the Prince Hall Masonic Temple to begin planning a campaign “to persuade utility companies in the South to discontinue discrimination in employment.”<span class="citation" data-cites="NEGROESSEEUTILITIES1961"><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></span> In Baltimore, student members of the local NAACP chapter organized pickets at the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company and the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company<!-- Where exactly? --> to call for equitable hiring of African Americans.<span class="citation" data-cites="NEGROSTUDENTSPICKET1961"><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></span><!-- I'm inferring from the context here. --></p>
<!-- Example of cultural workers. Does this belong here? -->
<p>Another example is the Arena Playhouse at 801 McCulloh Street occupied by the Arena Players, an African American theatre troupe, since 1962. Established in 1953 as an outgrowth of the “The Negro Little Theater”, the Arena Players spent a decade performing at varied locations including Coppin State University, the Druid Hill YMCA, the Great Hall Theater of St. Mary’s Church in Walbrook, and the Carl J. Murphy Auditorium at Morgan State University. After securing a long-term performance space, the Arena Players acquired the building in 1969 and through the 1970s continued to serve “as one of the only venues dedicated to showcasing the works of black playwrights and performers.”<span class="citation" data-cites="ArenaPlayersIncorporatedHistoryArenaPlayers"><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></span></p>

<p>In 1934, 13% of Baltimore whites and 40% of Baltimore blacks were on relief (?) according to a study by the Baltimore Urban League.<!-- Completely duplicative with the passage below. --> While the federal government’s New Deal programs brought some relief, discrimination persisted even in the administration of these programs. The <em>Afro-American</em> reported that an African American household with eight people received $8.94 a week for food but a white household of the same size received ​$12.70.<span class="citation" data-cites="FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998"><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Roderick Ryon notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>City relief was distributed by the Family Welfare Association, which reported in 1934 that 40 per cent of the city’s blacks, compared to 13 per cent of its whites, were on relief. The Urban League and a local association of the unemployed, studied 150 white and black relief cases in the same year and discovered that black families typically received smaller relief sums and were removed from relief rosters before whites.<span class="citation" data-cites="RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980"><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></span></p>

<!-- Missing transition! Look for information from the initial Urban League report on discrimination by local industry. -->
<p>In the 1930s, African American activists put growing pressure on public and private employers to end segregated hiring and begin offering more opportunities to African American workers. This pressure included both a renewed legal efforts backed by the NAACP at the local and national level and a series of grass-roots protest actions organized by activist groups like CORE, inter-religious coalitions like the Baltimore Council of Churches, and by students (especially from Morgan State College).</p>
<p>White unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor continued to exclude black workers. The loss of and were subject to the policy of “last hired and first fired” leading to widespread job loss.</p>
<!-- TODO: What proportion of black workers were employed in the service sector? How did employment opportunities vary by gender? Could this be a good place to talk about employment for blind or deaf workers? Or about black entrepreneurship? -->
<!-- Look for information about AFL and CIO union membership in Baltimore -->
<!-- TODO: There must have been more going on for black workers in this period than just the CIO. I think small business ownership should also be incorporated into this section. -->
<p>Cumberbatch also argues that by working “with both the Fair Employment Practices Committee and the CIO, civil rights leaders were able to break through racial barriers that had historically confined African Americans to the least paying and least desirable jobs.”<span class="citation" data-cites="CumberbatchWorkingracetransformation2001"><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Roderick Ryon notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Numbering 144,000 in a population of 817,000 in 1930, city blacks faced greater and different kinds of problems than whites. Substantial numbers were employed in 1930, but they occupied the lowest rung of the wage ladder. Indeed low wages for adult males had forced thousands of women, adolescents and the elderly on the job market to supplement meager family incomes. Eighty- five per cent of employable black males held jobs in 1930 compared to 77 percent of native whites, and 51 per cent of employable black women were wage earners, compared to 27 per cent of native whites.<span class="citation" data-cites="RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980"><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the low-paying domestic service offered some 26,000 jobs to Baltimore blacks in 1930,but as conditions worsened, hundreds of white employers, determined to “take care of their own” first, preferred whites over blacks. As some city industries began to recover they employed whites rather than rehire blacks, and by 1936, seventeen percent of Baltimore’s employable, skilled black males were out of work.<span class="citation" data-cites="RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980"><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Conducting a survey of 115 retail and manufacturing firms in 1933, the Urban League discovered that blacks constituted 8.3 per cent of the firm’s employees in 1933, compared to 9.2 per cent in 1930<span class="citation" data-cites="RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980"><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></span><!-- Break up these giant block quotes. --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, local unions, often, did little to help black Baltimoreans, as Ryon observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1931 black longshore-men walked out of a meeting of the City Federation of Labor rather than accept Jim Crow seating. Local white unions occasionally violated or evaded even sacred commandments of labor. When black brick layers arrived in the city, union cards in hand, they were offered free train fare out of the city, not the traditional welcome of newcomers. Rather than work with black union hod-carriers, whites in the AF of L bricklayers’ union used white scab labor.<span class="citation" data-cites="RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980"><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another important supporter of reform were black professional organizations such as the Progressive Engineers Association of Maryland (organized in 1938) and the MeDeSo (a club for black physicians and dentists established by Dr. J.E.T. Camper and others in 1942).<!-- Is this the right place for this information? Should there be a separate section on professional trades? --></p>
<p>In 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 which established Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) and lay a foundation for broader activism against discriminatory hiring. Such efforts were frustrated, however, by the weak support of many industrial unions for black workers and the racism of white workers. This challenge is exemplified in the example of Bethlehem Steel in 1943<!-- Check date! --> when white workers walked off the job in protest over the hiring of black workers.</p>
<p>Frustrations like this led Charles Hamilton Houston to resign from the FEPC on December 3, 1945 in a letter to President Truman and to hold a press conference exposing “Truman’s obstruction of the committee’s mandate and to mobilize pressure on the administration.” The FEPC ultimately expired six months later after being “starved of funds.”<span class="citation" data-cites="SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009"><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></span> Clarence Mitchell, still at the FEPC, praised Houston and the “National Council for a Permanent FEPC” saying without Houston’s advocacy “the agency would have been put to sleep with the issuance of some dry reports.” Mitchell said the “lesson to be learned” is that “minorities should never exchange immediate possibilities for real progress… for promises of future action,” and “those who profess”liberal convictions&quot; must be watched to make sure “the spoken word will be followed by concrete action.” After FEPC closed, Michell joined the NAACP’s Washington bureau as head of the new Department of Labor, fighting for legislation to support an equal employment agenda.<span class="citation" data-cites="SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009"><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></span></p>
<!-- How did this continue to change in the 1950s and 1960s? -->
<p>Increasing opportunity for industrial workers remained a major concern for the National Urban League. In the 1950s, the League established new connections to the Prince Hall Masons whose Supreme Council underwrote “demonstration vocational guidance institutes” in Baltimore, as well as Birmingham, St. Louis, and Pittsburgh.<span class="citation" data-cites="ParrisBlacksCityHistory1971"><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></span></p>

<p>An early sign of progress came in July 1937 when the Baltimore Police Department hired Violet Hill Whyte as the city’s first black police officer. Whyte, however, was not a uniform officer and did not carry a gun as part of her work.</p>
<p>Public workers had more success in the years after World War II than some private workers. In 1945, the NAACP won a critical legal victory to end a segregated training program at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in the case of Kerr v.

The new building became a civic and social center for African American residents in West Baltimore, hosting dance parties, lectures, and neighborhood meetings throughout the 1960s and 1970s. After the death of Melvin H. Cade, commanding officer of the 229th Battalion of the Maryland National Guard, in 1964, the Guard renamed the building in his honor.

<p>Lynching and criminal injustice was at the center of black organizing and advocacy around Civil Rights and racial injustice in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Such cases highlighted the important role of the Communist Party in supporting African American Civil Rights as a strategy for build supporting among African Americans broadly.</p>

<p>On December 4, 1931, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Williams_(laborer)">Matthew Williams</a> was lynched at Salisbury, Maryland—as the Maryland Historical Society <a href="http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2012/11/29/an-american-tragedy/">underbelly blog</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On December 4, 1931, Matthew Williams, an African American man, shot and killed his white employer in Salisbury and then turned the gun on himself in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. That evening, a mob of more than a thousand dragged Williams from his hospital bed where he lay critically wounded, and hung him up on the courthouse lawn. His body was then dragged to the town’s African American business district, and set on fire.  The Williams murder was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882, and the first since 1911.<!-- Break this up and paraphrase.--></p>

<p>On October 14, 1931, Euel Lee, known as “Orphan Jones”, was arrested for the murder of a white family reportedly over a disagreement about wages. The Maryland Communist Party took Lee’s case and lawyer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Ades">Bernard Ades</a> successfully moved Lee’s trial to Towson in Baltimore County. Ultimately, Ades lost the case (Lee was executed on October 28, 1933) but in the process helped to combat the informal prohibition on black jurors in Baltimore County.<!-- Citation missing! --></p>
