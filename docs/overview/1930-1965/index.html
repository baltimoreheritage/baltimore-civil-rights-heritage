        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Great Depression began with the Black Tuesday stock market crash on October 29, 1929. For Black Baltimoreans, already burdened by employment discrimination and segregated housing, the national economic crisis brought widespread job loss and even deeper poverty. Decades of legal and political advocacy by the Brotherhood of Liberty and local coalitions prevented the mass disenfranchisement found in other Southern towns and cities. But, despite the recent efforts by the new local branch NAACP, discrimination by white elected officials and residents made life difficult for Black Baltimoreans.<!-- Add some figures from the Urban League report?--> The <em>Baltimore Afro-American</em> neatly captured the perspective of many residents in 1933, when they labeled Baltimore a “border city with Southern feelings.”<span class="citation" data-cites="ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> Historians Bruce Thompson, Andor Skotnes, and others have assigned the beginning of Baltimore’s modern civil rights movement to this tumultous and challenging time.</p>
<p>From the outset of the Great Depression and through the beginning of World War II, Black residents, at times joined by some white anti-racists and progressive reformers, responded to these challenges with a renewed campaign of protests, fighting for fair administration of criminal justice, equal employment, and equal access to education. The years between 1930 and 1934, Skotnes argues, were “a particularly fluid and experimental period during which various groupings” of both labor and freedom movements “worked closely together.”<span class="citation" data-cites="SkotnesNewDealAll2012"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> Young Black people played an especially important role in the renewal of the local movement in the 1930s. In October 1931, two sisters, eighteen-year-old Juanita and twenty-year-old Virginia Jackson, responded to the shortage of jobs for Black young people by organizing the City-Wide Young People’s Forum at Sharp Street Church. Famed Black educator and activist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nannie_Helen_Burroughs">Nannie Helen Burroughs</a> (1879–1961) later described the group as: “the best, most progressive, and analytical organization of Negro young people in America. It feels, thinks, believes, acts.”<span class="citation" data-cites="ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Around the same time, a series of brutal incidents pushed residents towards more militant activism. The trial and execution of Euel Lee in 1932 and 1933 led to rising protests over inequitable sentencing and inadequate protection for Black defendants.<span class="citation" data-cites="SkotnesNewDealAll2012"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> The brutal lynching of George Armwood on October 18, 1933 took place after his removal from the City Jail and return to Princess Anne on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and shocked the conscience of many liberal white Marylanders. The attack galvanized Black support for proposed anti-lynching legislation.<span class="citation" data-cites="SkotnesNewDealAll2012"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> White Communists were among the most visible white allies of the civil rights movement at the time. For exmple, attorney Bernard Ades and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labor_Defense">International Labor Defense</a>, a legal advocacy organization associated with the Communist International, took on a prominent role in Lee’s defense and in anti-lynching activism in the early 1930s.<span class="citation" data-cites="INTERRACIALGROUPDEMANDS1933 ExclusiveAfroCoverage1933 INTERRACIALGROUPRAPS1933 SkotnesNewDealAll2012"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Between 1933 and 1936, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal">New Deal</a> offered some measure of relief. But the freedom movement continued to pressure local and state officials, along with business owners, to change discriminatory policies. Leveraging the popularity of the City-Wide Young People’s Forum, in September 1933, Juanita and Virginia’s mother, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillie_Mae_Carroll_Jackson">Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson</a> worked with twenty-five-year-old lawyer Thurgood Marshall, and others to recruit hundreds of young people to picket businesses on Pennsylvania Avenue that refused to hire Black workers. While a lawsuit by business-owners to bar further protests ultimately frustrated the success of the “Buy Where You Can Work” campaign, the effort drew the elder Jackson into a closer relationship with the Baltimore NAACP branch.<span class="citation" data-cites="FarrarSeeWhatAfro1983 SkotnesBuyWhereYou1994 TyrusProphetKiowaCostonie2002 SkotnesNewDealAll2012"><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> With encouragement from <em>Afro-American</em> newspaper editor Carl Murphy and attorney <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hamilton_Houston">Charles Hamilton Houston</a>, Lillie C. Jackson took over as the president of the branch in 1935 and remained in that position up until 1970.</p>
<p>By the end of the 1930s, the efforts of the local NAACP, the Baltimore Urban League, and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) locals tied Baltimore’s activists to a broader national movement more closely than ever before. One clear example is the substantial participation of Baltimore labor and freedom activists in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_Movement">March on Washington Movement</a> (organized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Philip_Randolph">A. Philip Randolph</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayard_Rustin">Bayard Rustin</a>) that successfully pushed President Roosevelt to sign <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_8802">Executive Order 8802</a> prohibiting discriminatory hiring in war-time industries. The order established the Fair Employment Practices Commission and thirty-year-old Clarence Mitchell (who had reported on George Armwood’s lynching for the <em>Afro</em> in 1934) joined the new commission as the associate director of field operations. Earlier that year, in December 1940, the CIO and partners launched a campaign to force the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_L._Martin_Company">Glenn L. Martin Company</a> in Baltimore County to begin training and hiring Black skilled workers. In October 1941, Soon after the creation of the FEPC, the campaign succeeded.<span class="citation" data-cites="SkotnesNewDealAll2012"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>

<p>The beginning of World War II led to other new approaches for the civil rights movement. Carl Murphy joined other Black newspaper editors and activists in pushing the “Double V” campaign seeking victory over fascism in Europe and victory over injustice at home in the United States. The <em>Afro</em> described segregation and discrimination as “Hitlerism” in their fight to influence public opinion.<span class="citation" data-cites="TerryTrampingjusticedismantling2002 FarrarSeeWhatAfro1983"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span><!-- Missing page number for Farrar. --> For Black residents subject to rising rents in overcrowded houses and brutal unjust policing in the city’s segregated Black neighborhoods the need for change was clear. After a Baltimore City police officer shot and killed Thomas Broadus, a black U.S. Army private from Pittsburgh, on February 7, 1942, a coalition of local activists known as the Citizen’s Committee for Justice organized to push the state to reign shootings and mistreatment by the Baltimore City Police. The committee was chaired by Carl Murphy, and including Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson, and Dr. John E.T. Camper, a physician and activist, and set a date for the mass March on Annapolis. On April 24, 1942, over two thousand Baltimoreans rode charter buses, shared cars for the drive, and even walked to the State House in Annapolis for a hearing with the Governor Herbert R. O’Conor. Voluntary contributions of eight hundred dollars covered the transportation costs for the people travelling to Annapolis and the crowd gathered with a reportedly, a “serious, sober attitude.”<span class="citation" data-cites="Berry000BaltimoreCitizens1942"><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Edward S. Lewis, executive secretary of the Urban League, testified on the “repeated efforts of citizens to get Police Commissioner Stanton to initiate preventive crime measures.” Lillie C. Jackson sought the “appointment of another colored policewoman”—the first Black non-uniformed police officer, Violet Hill Whyte, was hired in July 1937. Rev. E.W. White, secretary of the Citizen’s Committee, pastor at Provident Baptist Church, and a recent president of the Inter-denominational Ministers’ Alliance, argued that “colored people in Baltimore are inadequately and unjustly policed” and asked the Governor to name “colored policeman in uniform.” W.A.C. Hughes, Jr., attorney for the NAACP, sought an investigation of police killings in Baltimore. <a href="http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/015200/015298/html/15298bio.html">Linwood G. Koger</a>, an attorney, World War I veteran, and head of the Walter Green Post of the American Legion, asked the Governor to appoint a “colored magistrate” and Donald Boyce, 10th Ward Committeeman for the Republican City Committee, asked for removal of Commissioner <a href="http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/014400/014416/html/14416bio.html">Robert F. Stanton</a>.</p>
<p>Speakers at the hearing did not limit themselves to addressing police violence alone as they highlighted other forms of discrimination by the state. Carl Murphy asked the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_O%27Conor">Governor</a> to support President Roosevelt’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_8802">executive order</a> prohibiting discrimination in the defense industry. Mrs. Virgie Waters, president of the the Beauticians’ Association, “urged representation on the State board” regulating beauticians. Dr. Ralph Young, asked for Black participation on the Maryland Tuberculosis Commission telling the Governor “we need to have a part in administration of our own institutions.” Dr. George Crawley, leader of Saint Paul Baptist Church and president of the United Baptists of Maryland<!-- Check this organizational name. --> asked for “all colored staff and membership on [the] board of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crownsville_Hospital_Center">Crownsville State Hospital for Insane</a>”<!-- Double-check this quote. --> (established as the Hospital for the Negro Insane of Maryland in 1910). Twenty-one year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_A._Cole">Harry A.

<p>It was the largest freedom demonstration in Maryland history and it led Governor O’Conor to appoint the statewide Commission on Problems Affecting the Negro Population to consider the protestors concerns.<span class="citation" data-cites="TerryTrampingjusticedismantling2002"><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> The unprecedented protest drew on a dense network of relationships between supporters and activists, largely living in the segregated Black neighborhoods of east and west Baltimore. For example, march organizer Dr. John E.T. Camper lived at 639 N. Carey Street, just a few blocks west of Providence Baptist Church, whose pastor Rev. White was secretary to the Citizen’s Committee. Lillie C. Jackson’s home at 1226 Druid Hill Avenue also served as offices for the Citizen’s Committee and the NAACP. Edward Lewis lived at 1538 Division Street and the Urban League offices at 1841 Pennsylvania Avenue were only a few blocks away. Rev. G.A. Crawley lived at 1418 E. Biddle Street not far from Donald Boyce at 1419 E. Madison Street and Dr. Ralph Young at 1429 E. Monument Street. Countless other neighbors came out for mass meetings, joined protests, and supported the numerous Black neighborhood associations in existence at this time. These groups became a major source of organizing capacity and financial support for the Baltimore branch of the NAACP making the local civil rights movement “increasingly grassroots in character” during the late 1930s and early 1940s.[<span class="citation" data-cites="SkotnesNewDealAll2012">Skotnes,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span> 287-289; Neighborhood associations (combined with Lillie C.

<p>After 1942, Baltimore’s activist community continued to push. Liberal Republican Theodore McKeldin won office as Mayor in November 1942 (serving from 1943 to 1947) thanks to Black voters and extensive voter registration efforts by the NAACP in the early 1940s.<!--Check this.--> In March 1944, Mayor McKeldin appointed George McMechen, NAACP activist and attorney, as the first Black person on the Baltimore School Board. After the war ended in 1945, the landscape of race and activism began to quickly change as Black residents began purchasing homes in formerly segregated white neighborhoods west of Fulton Avenue. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_v._Kraemer">Shelley v. Kraemer</a></em> made the deed restrictions keeping out Black residents unenforceable and the crowding in segregated Black neighborhoods made Black households more willing to risk the antagonism of white neighbors in order to purchase a home for their family. At the same time, suburban builders began to put up huge numbers of new homes in Baltimore County with support from the Federal Housing Administration. Only white households could access these mortgages or suburban neighborhoods.<!-- NOTE: Incorporate notes from Hirsch on the federal role for housing in this period. --> The pace of neighborhood change increased dramatically in the spring of 1954 after the U.S. Supreme Court declared segregated public schools to be unconstitutional in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a></em>.</p>
<p>The landscape of partners and allies also changed after the war. Anti-Communist attacks by the local and federal government undermined the regional workers’ movement and, Skotnes observed, “antiracist struggle within the unions ebbed and the alliance with the freedom movement deteriorated.”<span class="citation" data-cites="SkotnesNewDealAll2012"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In 1946, William Preston Lane, Jr.—the state attorney general when a group of white Marylanders lynched George Armwood thirteen years earlier—defeated Mayor McKeldin in the election for Maryland Governor. Lane did little to change the state’s approach to civil rights. The entire board of the Cheltenham School for Boys resigned amid crticisms that the facility for young Black men operated as a penal work farm instead of a training school forcing Lane to appoint a new board that included nine Black members (Willard W.

<p>Between 1951 and 1959, Governor Theodore McKeldin delivered significant (albeit incremental) changes: establishing the Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations in 1951 and ending segregation at most state parks in 1953. Baltimore City also began to change in the early 1950s under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_D%27Alesandro_Jr.">Mayor Thomas D’Alesandro, Jr.</a> who served as Mayor from 1947 to 1959. In August 1951, the city school board opened Polytechnic High School to Black students on a limited basis. In 1953, the Baltimore City Fire Department appointed the city’s first Black firemen. In 1956, the city enacted an Equal Employment Ordinance.<!--This section needs additional context.--></p>

<p>In February 1951, the Maryland legislature finally changed state laws that had required racial segregation on trains and boats. Harry A.

<p>The gathering momentum and urgency of the movement (especially in the South) after the Supreme Court decision in <em>Brown v.

<p>While the significance of the <em>Brown</em> decision in undermining the legal basis for segregated public life was increasingly clear, many white Marylanders were intransigent in their support for segregation. In 1960, student activists from Morgan State College, Johns Hopkins University, and Goucher College with Baltimore’s Civic Interest Group (CIG) led the push for desegregation at downtown department stores and restaurants on Howard Street including Hutzler’s, Stewart’s, and Hoschild-Kohn’s.<!--When was CIG founded? Add a short history of the organization in a footnote.--> The next year, in 1961, after embarrassing incidents of discrimination against African diplomats at restaurants along U.S. Route 40 in Maryland and Delaware<!--Where?-->, CORE activists saw an opportunity to push for broader change. CORE recruited volunteers from CIG and several other organizations for the “Route 40 Project” to challenge the segregated facilities in a massive Freedom Ride on November 11, 1960. Just days before the ride began, however, forty-seven restaurants along Route 40 agreed to desegregate thanks to the activists and pressure from President John F. Kennedy’s administration. CORE called off the ride but sent the volunteers gathering at D.C.’s Howard University to Baltimore instead where they picketed some of the city’s segregated restaurants.<!-- Where?

As a generation earlier, Baltimore’s experienced community of activists and proximity to Washington, D.C. helped tie the work of local activists into a broader national agenda.</p>
<p>Despite the sympathies and support for some white Baltimoreans, many more residents used their priveleged positions to relocate to segregated white communities in the suburbs. In 1958, the Maryland State Commission on Interracial Problems compared Baltimore to cities like Detroit or Chicago (where violent attacks on new Black neighbors notoriously frequent) and observed that Baltimore’s problem “is not with violence but with the frigid withdrawal” of white residents.<span class="citation" data-cites="OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994"><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></span> White and Black activists recognized the challenges presented by persistent housing segregation in the Baltimore region early on. Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. was founded in 1959 by James Rouse, Ellsworth Rosen, and Sidney Hollander, Jr. to education residents about fair housing laws and push for stronger policies. Both local and federal policies played a major role in frustrating such grassroots efforts. Thousands of white residents left the city for federally subsidized suburban developments and the population of Baltimore County more than tripled between 1940 and 1960.

<p>Thirty-five years after the Young People’s Forum began, twenty-four years after the consequential March on Annapolis, and twelve years after the <em>Brown</em> decision, Black people in Baltimore continued to struggle against white resistance and racist policies, against employment discrimination, segregated and inadequate housing, unequal educational opportunities, and racist policing.</p>
<p>While the field of potential inquiry in this period in large and complex, this study has briefly focused on the areas of electoral politics, housing, education, employment, and public accomodations. The large number of significant events and associations make it difficult to ensure comprehensive coverage.</p>
<p>Baltimore’s resistance to disenfrachisement at the beginning of the twentieth century yielded significant victories in this period. However, the coalescing national movement met with resilience reactionary proponents of white supremacy regionally and at the state and the federal level. Housing remained a potent area of debate and frustration. From the 1930s through the 1950s, a severe shortage of housing created difficult conditions for thousands of Black Baltimoreans. Even before <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, the issue of housing segregation was closely linked to inequality and segregation in schools. The 1921 Strayer Report had prompted only limited improvements but the NAACP’s legal strategy began to show promise delivering the admission of Donald Murray to the University of Maryland and the equalization of Black and white teacher salaries. The difficult limits were also clear from the failure of an NAACP campaign to challenge segregated schools in Baltimore County and the frustration of a multi-year grassroots campaign to build a Black high school in Baltimore County. Likewise, Black workers continued to organize and seek better conditions and equitable hiring and found a partners in the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the Fair Practice Employment Commission. During and after World War II, public accommodations, including parks, pools, and recreational facilities, and consumer spaces, such as lunch counters, restaurants, and department stores. The language of American democracy and consumer politics were powerful tools for Black activists, and some white liberal allies, whose protests and activism dismantled countless Jim Crow policies in the 1940s and 1950s. Given the central role of the police in enforcing city and state policies (whether those are racial covenants or theft), the significant role of criminal injustice as the issue that drove the renewal of the movement again and again during the twentieth century. This theme links Baltimore’s participation in national anti-lynching advocacy in the 1930s with the protests over police violence represented by the 1942 March on Annapolis.</p>

<p>Electoral politics also reemerged as a major source of opportunity for change. A few months before the 1932 election, the Afro-American helped to organize a registration drive for black voters, highlighting the fact that in Baltimore City, “37,908 colored people are registered and ready to vote, and 54,000 of us are slackers and ineligible to cast a ballot because we have not registered.”<span class="citation" data-cites="GiveBaltimoreNew1932"><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></span></p>

<p>The Colored Women’s Democratic Campaign Committee organized by Victorine Q.

<!-- Missing information on 1930s Communist era interracial organizing -->
<p>Finally, spaces for organizing, community building, and mutual support continued to be an important resource for both white and black activists. One example is Levering Hall at the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University. In 1953, Chester Wickwire accepted a position as the executive secretary of the campus YMCA and the chaplain for the university. At Levering Hall, Wickwire provided “a haven for liberals on an otherwise conservative campus” and ran “ran various student life programs such as concerts, dances, and movie screenings while simultaneously organizing political discussions about civil rights, pacifism, the Cold War, and Vietnam.” Wickwire himself was an active participant in the civil rights movement and helped support student activists.<!-- Citation missing!

<h3 id="white-reaction-in-politics-after-wwii">White reaction in politics after WWII</h3>
<!-- What about pre 1950 reaction? -->
<p>Between 1950 and 1960, the population of Baltimore County grew by over 80% (from 270,273 to 492,428). In the same ten year period, Baltimore City lost population (dropping from 949,708 to 939,024) while the proportion of African American residents grew (23.70% to 34.67%). Between 1960 and 1970, the population of Baltimore County continue to grow (26.12% to 621,077). Between 1950 and 1970, the population of Anne Arundel County, the population grew by more than 250% (117,392 in 1950 to 206,634 in 1960 to 297,539 in 1970).</p>
<p>Racialized suburban growth, or “white flight”, functioned as an implicit strategy of white resistance to integration. White resistance also included more explicit and, at times, violent responses by white people who sought to maintain the status quo and supported elected officials who ran on their opposition to the civil rights movement. White Baltimoreans in the city and suburbs voted in support of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace">George C. Wallace</a> (the segregationist Democratic Governor of Alabama) in the 1964 Democratic primary and for Barry Goldwater (a Republican Senator and opponent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) in that year’s general election.</p>
<h2 id="housing">Housing</h2>
<p>The New Deal and World War II both led to major changes in the relationship of the city and state government to housing and transportation in Baltimore. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the racial transition of Baltimore central neighborhoods continued as it had intermittently for decades prior. In East Baltimore, African American congregations moved into buildings formerly occupied by white churches as, in 1929, the Episcopalian Church of the Holy Innocents sold their building to Grace Baptist Church and, in 1931, Baltimore’s oldest Black Roman Catholic congregation—St. Francis Xavier—purchased the Madison Square M.E. Church.<span class="citation" data-cites="HaywardOldEastBaltimore2005"><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></span></p>
<p>During the Great Depression, the shortage of new homes for both white and black buyers kept existing homeowners fixed in place and slowed the process of racial transition that had been underway in west and east Baltimore neighborhoods from the 1880s through the 1920s.</p>
<p>The lines of segregation were further reinforced by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) (established in 1933) which used infamous “red-lining” maps to discourage lending in neighborhoods where African Americans lived. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Housing_Act_of_1934">National Housing Act of 1934</a> created the Federal Housing Administration and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_Act_of_1937">Housing Act of 1937</a> provided a new source of federal funding for cities like Baltimore to engage in “slum clearance” and build new public housing projects. The federal government continued to shape housing policy after WWII with the approval of the Housing Act of 1949 on July 15, 1949.</p>
<p>These policy changes, and the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_v._Kraemer">Shelley v. Kraemer</a></em> ending the legal enforcement of racial covenants shaped changes in the areas of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public housing beginning in the late 1930s</li>
<li>Private housing beginning in the mid-1940s through racial transition and “white flight”</li>
<li>Transportation and land use policies that had a discriminatory affect on black neighborhoods</li>
</ul>
<p>Across the country, housing starts dropped by over 90% from a high of 937,000 in 1925 to 93,000 in 1933.<span class="citation" data-cites="HaywardBaltimoreRowhouse2001"><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></span></p>
<p>During the Great Depression, West Baltimore’s “color line” had stabilized around Fulton Avenue. Beginning in the late 1940s, however, neighborhoods at the edge of Old West Baltimore began to transition from white to black. The change was driven by a number of factors including the rapid growth of Baltimore’s African American population during the 1940s and 1950s, the intense overcrowding and deteriorating housing conditions within historically segregated African American neighborhoods, and the movement of white households out of the center city to the areas of new development in the Baltimore suburbs.</p>
<p>From January 1941 to November 1941 alone, housing vacancies for units open to African American occupancy shrank from .8% to .1%. In a letter to Mayor McKeldin in July 1945, in response to the efforts by a group of 350 residents in the Fulton Avenue area to prevent black residents from moving west, the NAACP argued “growth demands that we take in those streets that fringe our area since every attempt to enter new sections is vigorously denied.” The Citizens Committee for Justice and the Baltimore Urban League observed “the need for more housing is most sharply felt in the Negro community, where there are virtually no vacancies of any type.”<span class="citation" data-cites="MayorDiscussesNegro1945"><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></span></p>
<p>An October 1948 editorial in the Baltimore Sun described the “colored section of most cities” as “already dangerously overcrowded” and noted that only 2% of new housing built in 1948 was open to African Americans, despite representing 20% of Baltimore’s total population.<span class="citation" data-cites="SmallProportionNew1948"><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></span> By 1950, Baltimore had 226,053 black residents, representing 23.8% of the population but occupying only 19.4% of dwelling units. This pattern continued into the early 1950s: of the 53,000 permits issued new homes in Baltimore metropolitan area from 1950 to 1953, only 3,200 of those were open to African American households, even as the black population increased another 10%.<!-- Citation missing! --></p>
<p>While after WWII, the federal government began to profess support for Black Americans struggling with housing but substantive policy changes were missing. For example, Clarence Mitchell praised Albert Cole, Administrator of the HHFA for his “fine words” at an event in Detroit but noted that Cole avoided “the basic problem.” Mitchell predicted “we shall continue to have the Levittown, Birmingham, and Baltimore type of problem,” officially sanctioned residential segregation, until the federal government adopted a “flat policy” of non-discrimination.<span class="citation" data-cites="Hirschlastmostdifficult2005"><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></span></p>

<p>When African American residents began responding to this housing crisis by purchasing homes in formerly segregated white neighborhoods some white resident met them with violence. In 1945, a group of people, described by the <em>Baltimore Afro American</em> as “hoodlums who resented having the Millers move into a white neighborhood,” threw bricks at the home of James Miller and his family at 816 N. Fulton Avenue, breaking glass in the front door and windows.<span class="citation" data-cites="FultonAvenueHome1945"><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></span> The newspaper expanded on this account writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of at least fifty houses on Fulton Avenue now owned by colored persons between the 500 and 1800 blocks, only one case of violence has been reported by one of the three families now known to occupy homes there. The James Miller family, which moved into 816 N. Fulton Avenue on February 15, reported that bricks were thrown through a window and door panel on the following Saturday. The second floor of this house is occupied by the William Montgomery family… Among Fulton Avenue property owners are the Rev. Hiram J. Smith, Dr. Bruce Alleyne and the Medicos Club, an organization of physicians and dentists. “For Sale” signs may be seen all along Fulton Avenue.<span class="citation" data-cites="50HomesOwned1945"><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In August 1948, a house on the 1300 block of Payson Street just to the north of the district was subject to an arson attempt, attributed to retaliation against a white Jewish home-owner who had “broken” the block by selling a property to an African American homeowner in 1946.<span class="citation" data-cites="RacialHatredBlamed1948"><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></span> In July 1950 after Ms. Beatrice Sessoms, a native of North Carolina who came to Baltimore two years earlier, moved with her nephew to the 2300 block of Lauretta Avenue, her house was attacked.<span class="citation" data-cites="HomeBuyerStanding1950"><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></span> Dr. Ed Orser quotes one black West Baltimore resident recalling the experience of white flight in the late 1940s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Black people started moving out of the confined areas somewhere around 1947 or 1948, but what would happen was that whites would evacuate a block or two blocks, and black people would move in. The evacuation would take place first. I remember streets like Fulton Avenue, Monroe Street—they were once totally white, and they went through the transition and changed somewhere between 1946 and 1949—that was the time I was in service. When I went in, there were no black people when I came out, there they were black streets… But it wasn’t integration… it was an evacuation.<span class="citation" data-cites="OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994"><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These initial movements soon accelerated, particularly in west and northwest areas of Baltimore. Lula Jones Garrett, a columnist for the <em>Baltimore Afro</em>, observed in a column titled “Change-the-Address New Game on Baltimore Front” writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What with the local yokels forsaking the ghettos and moving into swankier mansions, it takes a special edition of the directory to locate your best friends these days.“<span class="citation" data-cites="GarrettChangetheAddressNewGame1949"><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The process of this rapid transition is closely associated with negative accounts of realtors or “block-busters” using a range of tactics to take advantage of both white sellers and black buyers. For example, during the 1940s and 1950s many African American households purchased home under land-installment contracts or buy-like-rent arrangements, also known as lease option contracts, that allowed home-owners to purchase property without an initial down payment or closing charges. However, these arrangements did not immediately transfer title to the property and the contract could still be terminated if the new home-owner missed a single payment. Although the black home-ownership rate rose by 194% between 1940 and 1950, in comparison to 58.8% for whites, a 1955 survey by the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations found that 53% of their respondents had purchased their homes through such arrangements rather than regular financing.<span class="citation" data-cites="OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994"><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></span> <!-- This citation doesn't include the increase in homeownership rates although it may be on another page of Orser. --></p>
<p>According to an interview with Antero Pietella, in 1947, Thomas Cripps witnessed a man with suit in the area around his home at 2323 Mosher Street carrying signs “This House is Not for Sale,” with the implication that the neighborhood was imminently threatened with transition. Cripps’ family became the first household on the block to sell their property to a black family when they sold their home in 1949 to Ellsworth F.

<p>The issue reached Edmondson Village around 1955, when the first black residents moved west of the Gwynns Falls to live in the southeast corner of the region, around the western end of the Baltimore Street Bridge. One white resident remarked on the experience, commenting to Dr. Ed Orser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the [black] people started moving into the neighborhood, they did come in, literally block by block.

<p>In April 1958, the improvement group organized their annual meeting at School No. 88 located at Wildwood Parkway and Gelston Drive, hosting Chief Judge Delany Foster of the Orphans Court of Baltimore as the guest speaker. In July 1958, Association president L.E. Larsen gave the association’s support to a plan sponsored by the Baltimore Urban League, the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations, and the Citizens Planning and Housing Association to “combat the conversion of Baltimore areas from all-white to all-Negro occupancy.” Larsen observed that Edmondson Village:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>An African American resident in this period later shared her experience in an oral history with Dr. Ed Orser, remarking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we first moved to the neighborhood, it was more white – we were just about the second black family on this block… We could see the changes, because when we moved, there were so many sale signs all around, and it did make a difference in the neighborhood, because there was a change, and you had to get yourself adjusted to the people who were moving in, and you couldn’t really know the ones who were moving out, because they were leaving so fast, so we were really going through a transitional stage. People were moving in and out overnight; you didn’t really know who your neighbors were.

<p>By 1960, however, the area south of Edmondson Village had changed from more than 99% white in 1950 to 62% black in 1960 and, a decade later, 92% black in 1970.

<p>Many downtown department stores refused to allow black shoppers to try on clothes, return clothes after a purchase, or provide service to black shoppers at all. In addition, store restaurants and lunch counters refused to seat African American diners offering them take out service or no service at all. In 1945, the <em>Afro-American</em> newspaper began the “Orchid and Onion” campaign to celebrate stores that did not discrimination against black shopper (“Orchids”) and shame downtown department stores with discriminatory policies (“Onions”).<span class="citation" data-cites="FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998"><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Black people faced similar policies of separation and discrimination at local theaters as well as stores. In addition, theaters often refused to book black musicians and performers. On February 1, 1948, the Baltimore police arrested a group of Morgan State College students for picketing Ford’s Theater on Fayette Street. The students and other activists soon returned and continued a five year campaign to end segregated seating at Ford’s Theater. Finally, in 1953, Ford’s Theatre ended segregated seating. After the Lyric Theatre on Mt. Royal Avenue refused to allow singer and activist Marian Anderson to perform, Baltimore’s Commission on Human Relations intervened and persuaded the theatre owners to allow Marian Anderson to appear in January 1954. Despite this progress, however, most hotels and restaurants remained segregated so, after the performance, Sidney Hollander, Sr. hosted an afternoon reception with Anderson at his home. <!-- TODO: Where did Sidney Hollander, Sr. live?

<!-- Public accommodations section from 1954-1968 -->
<p>The discrimination African Americans faced in public accommodations was not just one of simple exclusion. Historian Paul A. Kramer notes that the discriminatory “racial practices” at Baltimore’s downtown department stores included three main aspects:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Discrimination in employment (only hired as maintenance or stockroom workers, elevator operators, porters, and restroom attendants; not higher-paying, higher-status jobs)</li>
<li>Refusal to serve African American customers at lunch counters</li>
<li>Policies prohibiting African American customers from trying on or returning clothing</li>
</ol>
<p>The prohibition on returns from African American customers (known as the “final sale” policy) reveals one of the fundamental motivation behind racial segregation: “anxieties and fears about physical contact between whites and blacks”. Kramer continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For most whites, blacks represented sources of unspecified physical and moral pollution … Black and white bodies might “touch” in the exchange of forks and plates at store lunch-counters. Even more threatening to whites was the possibility that the clothes they tried on or purchased might bear an invisible taint of black physical contact.<span class="citation" data-cites="KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003"><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notably, in early 1943, when the Baltimore NAACP sought to overturn the state’s Jim Crow laws, the repeal bill they supported was sent to state legislature <em>Hygiene Committee</em> rather than <em>Judiciary Committee</em> for consideration.<span class="citation" data-cites="KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003"><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></span></p>
<p>One early challenge to these segregationist policies came in 1953 with an interracial group of CORE activists using sit-ins to protest segregated lunch counters (a strategy used previously in New York City in 1939 and by other CORE activists in Chicago in 1942). The success of their efforts was noted in the regular column of Mrs. B.M. Phillips (“If You Ask Me”) in the Afro-American Newspaper on November 7, 1953:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the Committee On Racial Equality, (CORE), the Urban league, and the Americans for Democratic Action, (ADA), more stores in the 200 block W. Lexington st. are realizing there is no color line in the dollars you spend. Lunch counters and restaurants in the Kresge and Woolworth Five and Ten have been serving all customers for several weeks. McCrory’s has just reversed its policy and will serve all comers […] Schulte United in the 200 block Lexington is still acting silly.<span class="citation" data-cites="PhillipsIfYouAsk1953"><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The success, however, was limited. One 1955 survey found that 91% of 191 randomly-selected Baltimore businesses reported either the “exclusion” or “segregation” of blacks.<span class="citation" data-cites="KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003"><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></span> The annual report of the Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations also provided updates on discriminatory policies listing “places of public accommodations [that] are open to all” in March 1958.</p>
<p>As Phillips alludes in her column, the issue of public accommodation was often presented in terms of consumer politics. This made the issue personal for middle-class black activists like Mrs. Madeline W. Murphy who wrote to the Vice President of Hoschild Kohn in 1956 to say “not only [do I] feel equal to the average Hochschild Kohn’s consumers but I feel superior to them.” Such emphasis on racial equality as individual access made the desegregation of public accommodations “less of a challenge to traditional notions of racial equality” (in contrast to education, employment, and voting rights) and helped secure the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.<span class="citation" data-cites="SalvatoreCivilRightsAmerica2004"><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></span></p>
<p>CORE’s downtown campaign faded after the successful desegregation of the Read’s Drug Store lunch counter in January 1955. A new movement of students took up the cause on March 26, 1960 when black student activists from Morgan State University attempted to purchase food at department store restaurants at the Northwood Shopping Center and downtown. The student’s tried to purchase lunch at four downtown department stores. The succeeded at Hochschild Kohn; Sewart’s shut their food counters to all customers, white and black; Hutzler’s refused to serve a group of twenty students who waited for three hours before leaving.</p>
<p>The sit-ins continued through April 17, 1960, Easter Sunday when the <em>Sun</em> reported that Albert D. Hutzler met with Furman Templeton from the Urban League, along with activists David Glenn and Robert B. Watts. After the meeting, Hutzler announced: “We have lifted restrictions. Negroes will be served in our restaurants.” Hecht-May and other downtown stores followed Hoschild Kohn and Hutzler’s with the change.</p>
<p>A large collection of letters sent to Hoschild Kohn after their policy change in late March 1960 reflect attitudes to desegregation in the period. Interestingly, there are ten times the number of letters in support of integration but that is likely because activists saw the urgency of continuing the policy and saw integration as “frighteningly reversible.” Some opponents of desegregation described a rationale of “consumer choice”, as one woman wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you realize that by so doing [integrating], you are taking from the White Race any choice they had of segregation or integration when dining outside of their homes?<span class="citation" data-cites="KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003"><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others threatened to stay away from the downtown store, now that the policy of segregation had been abandoned. Paul Kramer notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>more than one of the racist critics wrote as self-conscious suburbanites, warning the downtown that integration would further provoke the flight of white residences and businesses. In the process, they revealed the extent to which the suburbs were imagined as racial islands still free of black “invasion”: downtown segregation was the only remaining draw that could pull whites in from their comfortable, newly-designed racial enclaves.<span class="citation" data-cites="KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003"><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notably, department stores had their own role in the suburban exodus with Hutzler’s stores in Towson (1952), Eastpoint (1956), Westview (1958); and Hoschild Kohn’s in Edmondson Village (1947).<!-- Citation missing! I think this is sourced from Orser. -->Black Baltimoreans also saw the importance role of suburbanization in reshaping the debate over segregated public accommodations in downtown Baltimore. For example, in August 1957, the <em>Afro</em>’s “If You Ask Me” columnist Elizabeth Murphy Phillips observed:</p>

<p>Around the United States, the push for public accommodations continued in the 1950s, as a 2004 report from the National Historic Landmarks program describes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the 1950s, a number of northern and western states adopted legislation prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations. Joining the eighteen states with such laws already on the books were Oregon (1953), Montana (1955), New Mexico (1955), Vermont (1957), Maine (1957), Idaho (1959), and Alaska (1959). In 1961, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming brought the total number of states with anti-segregations statutes up to twenty-eight. In addition, several cities in states that did not have public accommodations laws passed their own versions, including Wilmington, Delaware; Baltimore, Maryland; St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri; and El Paso, Texas.<span class="citation" data-cites="SalvatoreCivilRightsAmerica2004"><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></span></p>

<p>While teacher salaries had been effectively equalized for white and Black teachers in Baltimore City in 1925, other jurisdictions around the state continued to discriminate against Black educators.

<p>Even as Francis Wood, along with many black teachers and families, advocated for improvements to black schools within the segregated system, others fought to end school segregation at every level from elementary schools to universities.</p>
<p>The best known case in this period was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_v._Pearson">Murray v.

<p>The win was celebrated at the annual meeting of the national NAACP in Baltimore, in the “midst of presidential election season.” The event attracted more than five hundred delegates, including two hundred youth delegates organized by Juanita Jackson, and, according to Patricia Sullivan “offered a venue for delegates to report on developments in their communities to a nationally representative group; develop contacts; debate, refine, and develop strategies and tactics; and see their efforts within the full context of NAACP activity.”<span class="citation" data-cites="SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009"><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></span> In a speech at the meeting, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Francis_White">Walter Francis White</a>, referenced the recent victory in the <em>Murray</em> case, saying: “If you are willing to struggle with us… who knows but there may be Negroes in the universities of states such as Mississippi and Arkansas?”<span class="citation" data-cites="SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009"><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></span></p>

<!-- This section feels disjointed and thin on details. -->
<p>Unlike many other Southern cities and other jurisdictions in Maryland, the Baltimore City School Board, chaired by Walter Sondheim, responded quickly to the 1954 Supreme Court decision in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v.Board_of_Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a> by announcing a plan to end legal segregation. The city continued the long-standing policy of “open-enrollment” (where any student could attend any school) but dropped the requirement that Black students attend segregated “colored schools.”</p>
<p>After a brief outbreak of unrest at four recently integrated white public schools, representatives of nineteen civic, religious, educational and labor groups came together to form the Coordinating Council for Civic Unity to support the “peaceful opening of schools.” The group, composed largely of white organizations, reportedly “served as an information clearing house and ‘fire brigade’ on the alert for other racial friction.”<span class="citation" data-cites="ParrisBlacksCityHistory1971"><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Standing in contrast to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_resistance">“massive resistance”</a> seen elsewhere in the South, Baltimore’s move won praise at the time, but historian Howard Baum notes the critical flaw in the plan: “Explicitly, [the school board] would not discriminate against black children; implicitly, neither would it act on their behalf.”<span class="citation" data-cites="BaumBrownBaltimore2011"><a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></span> For white families, the policy likely “added to racial anxiety”, as Baum notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parents could not know what a school’s makeup would be when classes started…. This uncertainty not only added to anxiety but also made leaving city public schools a choice with a more predictable outcome.“<span class="citation" data-cites="BaumBrownBaltimore2011"><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></span><!-- Using this quote along seems to privilege the experience of white parents above Black students. --></p>

<p>But within a few years, after 1954, there were two trends in enrollment. The first was the slow growing<!--Word choice?--> but moderate racial integration of city schools. The second was the school district’s transition from majority white to a majority Black student enrollment.<span class="citation" data-cites="BaumBrownBaltimore2011"><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></span> By 1960, a majority of students in Baltimore’s school district were black. One-third of Black students now attended formerly white schools but many students still attended segregated schools.</p>
<p>In 1963, a group of white and Black parents, known as 28 Parents, presented a report to the school board describing how students continued to experience <em>de facto</em> segregation. The activists identified three contributing factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The construction of new schools in racially segregated neighborhoods; making a segregated student population more likely</li>
<li>The preference for enrolling neighborhood children when schools were “overcrowded”; again reinforcing existing patterns of segregation</li>
<li>Administrative actions to discourage integration. Baum notes, “Some white principals encouraged white parents to transfer their children out when black enrollment grew. Some principals reject black transfer applications to predominantly white schools.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Even within integrated schools, “ability tracking” separated black and white students within the building. The 28 Parents report highlighted a disturbing reality for Civil Rights activists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a decade of legal segregation, most children attended class with majorities of their own race… By the time the board ended practices that limited choices, the desegregation policy had a ten-year history associated in the public mind with continuing segregation.“<span class="citation" data-cites="BaumBrownBaltimore2011"><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></span><!-- Is this a quote from Baum or from the 28 Parents report? Citation is confusing. --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Civil_Rights_Act">1964 Civil Rights Act</a> created a federal interest in desegregating schools encouraging the city to take further action. ## Employment</p>
<p>In 1949, the Baltimore City Medical Society, a local professional association for doctors, voted to admit African American members.</p>
<p>From July 14 to July 16 1961, members of the Student Non-Violence Coordinating Committee (including representatives from all sixteen Southern states and Washington, D.C.) met at the Prince Hall Masonic Temple to begin planning a campaign “to persuade utility companies in the South to discontinue discrimination in employment.”<span class="citation" data-cites="NEGROESSEEUTILITIES1961"><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></span> In Baltimore, student members of the local NAACP chapter organized pickets at the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company and the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company<!-- Where exactly? --> to call for equitable hiring of African Americans.<span class="citation" data-cites="NEGROSTUDENTSPICKET1961"><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></span><!-- I'm inferring from the context here. --></p>

<p>Another example is the Arena Playhouse at 801 McCulloh Street occupied by the Arena Players, an African American theatre troupe, since 1962. Established in 1953 as an outgrowth of the “The Negro Little Theater”, the Arena Players spent a decade performing at varied locations including Coppin State University, the Druid Hill YMCA, the Great Hall Theater of St. Mary’s Church in Walbrook, and the Carl J. Murphy Auditorium at Morgan State University. After securing a long-term performance space, the Arena Players acquired the building in 1969 and through the 1970s continued to serve “as one of the only venues dedicated to showcasing the works of black playwrights and performers.”<span class="citation" data-cites="ArenaPlayersIncorporatedHistoryArenaPlayers"><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></span></p>

<p>“The <em>Afro</em> regularly exposed racial discrimination in the relief system and publicized the actions of those who fought it. … It reported on the activities of predominantly Black unions such as ILA Local 858 and on integrated unions such as the MWIU and the ACW, and it approvingly covered the interracial activities of labor radicals and industrial unionists.”<span class="citation" data-cites="SkotnesNewDealAll2012"><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></span></p>

<p>While the federal government’s New Deal programs brought some relief, discrimination persisted even in the administration of these programs.

<blockquote>
<p>City relief was distributed by the Family Welfare Association, which reported in 1934 that 40 per cent of the city’s blacks, compared to 13 per cent of its whites, were on relief.

<!-- Missing transition! Look for information from the initial Urban League report on discrimination by local industry. -->
<p>In the 1930s, African American activists put growing pressure on public and private employers to end segregated hiring and begin offering more opportunities to African American workers. This pressure included both a renewed legal efforts backed by the NAACP at the local and national level and a series of grass-roots protest actions organized by activist groups like CORE, inter-religious coalitions like the Baltimore Council of Churches, and by students (especially from Morgan State College).</p>
<p>Through the 1940s, white unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor continued to exclude black workers. A major change took place in 1939, when Edward Lewis with the Baltimore Urban League organized an “independent group of Black construction workers,” known as the Building Trades Association (BTA), sought to integrate te segregated white construction works’ locals. Despite stuff resistance, the group succeeded in their push for the integration of the Bricklayers Union working on the Poe housing project in 1939. By January 1941, thanks to further organizing and advocacy, one hundred and ten Black carpenters, all members of Local 544 of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, had found work on government projects.<span class="citation" data-cites="SkotnesNewDealAll2012"><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></span></p>

<p>Historian Roderick Ryon notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Numbering 144,000 in a population of 817,000 in 1930, city blacks faced greater and different kinds of problems than whites. Substantial numbers were employed in 1930, but they occupied the lowest rung of the wage ladder. Indeed low wages for adult males had forced thousands of women, adolescents and the elderly on the job market to supplement meager family incomes. Eighty- five per cent of employable black males held jobs in 1930 compared to 77 percent of native whites, and 51 per cent of employable black women were wage earners, compared to 27 per cent of native whites.<span class="citation" data-cites="RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980"><a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the low-paying domestic service offered some 26,000 jobs to Baltimore blacks in 1930,but as conditions worsened, hundreds of white employers, determined to “take care of their own” first, preferred whites over blacks. As some city industries began to recover they employed whites rather than rehire blacks, and by 1936, seventeen percent of Baltimore’s employable, skilled black males were out of work.<span class="citation" data-cites="RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980"><a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Conducting a survey of 115 retail and manufacturing firms in 1933, the Urban League discovered that blacks constituted 8.3 per cent of the firm’s employees in 1933, compared to 9.2 per cent in 1930<span class="citation" data-cites="RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980"><a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></span><!-- Break up these giant block quotes. --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, local unions, often, did little to help black Baltimoreans, as Ryon observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1931 black longshore-men walked out of a meeting of the City Federation of Labor rather than accept Jim Crow seating. Local white unions occasionally violated or evaded even sacred commandments of labor. When black brick layers arrived in the city, union cards in hand, they were offered free train fare out of the city, not the traditional welcome of newcomers. Rather than work with black union hod-carriers, whites in the AF of L bricklayers’ union used white scab labor.<span class="citation" data-cites="RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980"><a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another important supporter of reform were black professional organizations such as the Progressive Engineers Association of Maryland (organized in 1938) and the MeDeSo (a club for black physicians and dentists established by Dr. J.E.T. Camper and others in 1942).<!-- Is this the right place for this information? Should there be a separate section on professional trades? --></p>
<p>In 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 which established Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) and lay a foundation for broader activism against discriminatory hiring.<span class="citation" data-cites="SkotnesNewDealAll2012"><a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></span><!-- Better citation needed. --></p>
<p>Such efforts were frustrated, however, by the weak support of many industrial unions for black workers and the racism of white workers. This challenge is exemplified in the example of Bethlehem Steel in 1943<!-- Check date! --> when white workers walked off the job in protest over the hiring of black workers.</p>
<p>Frustrations like this led Charles Hamilton Houston to resign from the FEPC on December 3, 1945 in a letter to President Truman and to hold a press conference exposing “Truman’s obstruction of the committee’s mandate and to mobilize pressure on the administration.” The FEPC ultimately expired six months later after being “starved of funds.”<span class="citation" data-cites="SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009"><a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></span> Clarence Mitchell, still at the FEPC, praised Houston and the “National Council for a Permanent FEPC” saying without Houston’s advocacy “the agency would have been put to sleep with the issuance of some dry reports.” Mitchell said the “lesson to be learned” is that “minorities should never exchange immediate possibilities for real progress… for promises of future action,” and “those who profess”liberal convictions&quot; must be watched to make sure “the spoken word will be followed by concrete action.” After FEPC closed, Michell joined the NAACP’s Washington bureau as head of the new Department of Labor, fighting for legislation to support an equal employment agenda.<span class="citation" data-cites="SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009"><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></span></p>

<p>Increasing opportunity for industrial workers remained a major concern for the National Urban League. In the 1950s, the League established new connections to the Prince Hall Masons whose Supreme Council underwrote “demonstration vocational guidance institutes” in Baltimore, as well as Birmingham, St. Louis, and Pittsburgh.<span class="citation" data-cites="ParrisBlacksCityHistory1971"><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></span></p>

<p>An early sign of progress came in July 1937 when the Baltimore Police Department hired Violet Hill Whyte as the city’s first black police officer. Whyte, however, was not a uniform officer and did not carry a gun as part of her work.</p>
<p>Public workers had more success in the years after World War II than some private workers. In 1945, the NAACP won a critical legal victory to end a segregated training program at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in the case of Kerr v. Enoch Pratt Free Library (1945).<span class="citation" data-cites="JacksonDiscriminationdeferredHow2008 HerzogKerrPrincipleState2007"><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></span> In 1953, the Baltimore City Fire Department appointed their first African American firemen.</p>
<!-- One example of a building that was built after *Brown* but reflects this same logic of a "separate but equal" facility is the Melvin Cade National Guard Armory where the state decided to maintain a segregated black National Guard unit and, in 1960, erected a new building for the unit at 2620 Winchester Street. The new building became a civic and social center for African American residents in West Baltimore, hosting dance parties, lectures, and neighborhood meetings throughout the 1960s and 1970s. After the death of Melvin H. Cade, commanding officer of the 229th Battalion of the Maryland National Guard, in 1964, the Guard renamed the building in his honor. Baltimore City listed the Armory as a local landmark in 2009. -->

<p>Lynching and criminal injustice was at the center of black organizing and advocacy around Civil Rights and racial injustice in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Such cases highlighted the important role of the Communist Party in supporting African American Civil Rights as a strategy for build supporting among African Americans broadly.</p>

<p>On December 4, 1931, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Williams_(laborer)">Matthew Williams</a> was lynched at Salisbury, Maryland—as the Maryland Historical Society <a href="http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2012/11/29/an-american-tragedy/">underbelly blog</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On December 4, 1931, Matthew Williams, an African American man, shot and killed his white employer in Salisbury and then turned the gun on himself in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. That evening, a mob of more than a thousand dragged Williams from his hospital bed where he lay critically wounded, and hung him up on the courthouse lawn. His body was then dragged to the town’s African American business district, and set on fire.  The Williams murder was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882, and the first since 1911.<!-- Break this up and paraphrase.--></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On October 14, 1931, Euel Lee, known as “Orphan Jones”, was arrested for the murder of a white family reportedly over a disagreement about wages. The Maryland Communist Party took Lee’s case and lawyer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Ades">Bernard Ades</a> successfully moved Lee’s trial to Towson in Baltimore County. Ultimately, Ades lost the case (Lee was executed on October 28, 1933) but in the process helped to combat the informal prohibition on black jurors in Baltimore County.<!-- Citation missing! --></p>

<p>a mob of a thousand or more people stormed into the Princess Anne jail house and hauled Armwood from his cell down to the street below. Before he was hung from a tree some distance away, Armwood was dragged through the streets, beaten, stabbed, and had one ear hacked off.  Armwood’s lifeless body was then paraded through the town, finally ending up near the town’s courthouse, where the mob doused the corpse with gasoline and set it on fire.<!-- Citation missing! --><!-- Break this up and paraphrase.--></p>
