        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>From 1954 to 1968, the residents of Baltimore experienced a dramatic transformation with major changes to local, state and national policies on Civil Rights. Between 1950 and 1953, Civil Rights activists won a series of small but promising victories: the integration of trains and boats by the state legislature and the end of segregated seating at Ford’s Theatre and a few downtown lunch counters. Even greater dramatic changes followed the 1954 Supreme Court decision in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>.<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_brown_2011"><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> The decision, argued before the court by Thurgood Marshall, led the city to end the legal separation of Baltimore’s public schools between white and colored. The decision also empowered local activists, buoyed by rising expectations after World War II, to expand their fight for integrated public accommodations, open housing, and political power.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, activists succeeded in pushing Civil Rights to the forefront of public discussion on civic issues. In 1955, the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> started to turn away from a legacy of racist reporting to publish “The City We Live In”: a series of articles highlighting the injustice facing black Baltimoreans. As Governor (1951-1959) and Mayor (1943-1947 and 1963-1967), Theodore McKeldin reflected the broader response by liberal elected officials and residents who met the persistent demands of the Civil Rights movement with incremental change; ending segregation policies at state parks in 1953; at public pools and beaches in 1955; and supporting the Baltimore City Equal Employment Ordinance in 1956.</p>
<p>Just as the 1960 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro_sit-ins">Greensboro sit-ins</a> demonstrate the changing nature of the Civil Rights movement at the national level, the expanding scope of the fight for Civil Rights is illustrated in Baltimore by earlier efforts to desegregate downtown lunch counters and department stores.<span class="citation" data-cites="cohen_consumers_2003 glickman_buying_2009"><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> Beginning in 1953 and continuing in 1954 and 1955, white and black activists with the Baltimore chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) began to hold sit-in protests at “five-and-dime” lunch counters on Lexington Street. In 1960, activists pushed for desegregation at larger downtown department stores and restaurants on Howard Street including Hutzler’s, Stewart’s, and Hoschild-Kohn’s. Students from Morgan State College and other area schools (organized as the Civic Interest Group) played an essential part in 1955 and in 1960—an indicator of the growing importance of the student movement.<span class="citation" data-cites="kramer_white_2003 meier_successful_1989 palumbos_student_1999"><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The gathering momentum and urgency of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore and around the country helped secure federal policy changes with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957">Civil Rights Act of 1957</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1960">Civil Rights Act of 1960</a>. The 1957 legislation, signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, was the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction, created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Commission_on_Civil_Rights">U.S. Commission on Civil Rights</a>. The Commission—though initially limited to fact-finding—played a key role in documenting injustice. Congress granted the Commission expanded authority under the 1964 Civil Rights legislation. African American women, who experienced the double burden of both racial and gender discrimination (what activists and scholar Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw termed intersectionality), could see progress with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Pay_Act_of_1963">Equal Pay Act of 1963</a> and new protections against gender discrimination included with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
<p>Baltimore’s proximity to Washington, D.C. often tied local activist efforts to a broader federal and national agenda. In 1961, after embarrassing incidents of discrimination against African diplomats at restaurants along U.S. Route 40 in Maryland and Delaware, CORE activists saw an opportunity to push for broader change. CORE recruited volunteers from Baltimore’s Civic Interest Group (CIG) and several other organizations for the “Route 40 Project” to challenge the segregated facilities in a massive Freedom Ride on November 11. Just days before the ride began, however, forty-seven restaurants along Route 40 agreed to desegregate thanks to the activists and pressure from the Kennedy administration. CORE called off the ride but sent the volunteers gathering at Howard University to Baltimore instead where they picketed to protest the city’s segregated restraurants.<span class="citation" data-cites="banks_cores_2011 erdman_eyes_2007"><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The national significance of Baltimore’s movement is evident again in 1963, when black church leaders, business owners, and Civil Rights activists worked to recruit and transport thousands of Baltimore residents to Washington, D.C. for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom">March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</a>. In 1966, CORE’s announcement of the “Baltimore Target City Project” attracted national media attention. Although the project failed to deliver on CORE’s ambitious announcement, the nation’s focus on inequality in Baltimore pushed McKeldin to establish the Mayor’s Task Force for Civil Rights (also known as the Baltimore Community Relations Commission) focused on taking action on housing, public accommodations, employment, health and welfare, police-community relations, and education.<span class="citation" data-cites="mckeldin_state_1966"><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In parallel to these efforts to build black power at the national level, other residents focused on building political power for African Americans at the local level. The Colored Women’s Democratic Club organized by Victorine Q. Adams in 1946 and regular voter registration campaigns by the NAACP in the 1940s, led directly to the election of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_A._Cole">Harry A. Cole</a> to the Maryland State Senate in 1954 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verda_Welcome">Verda Welcome</a> in 1962. Cole was first African American ever elected to the Maryland Senate and Welcome was the first black woman to be elected to any state senate in the country—key victories for African Americans seeking change through representation in local and state government. However, these victories also reflected a city where African Americans made up a growing share of the electorate as white residents fled to the suburbs.</p>

<p>In 1954, many local leaders and activists celebrated the Baltimore school board, chaired Walter Sondheim, for their quick response to <em>Brown</em>. The city continued the long-standing policy of “open-enrollement” (any student could attend any school) but dropped the requirement that black students attend segregated “colored schools”. Although it won praise at the time, historian Howard Baum notes the critical flaw in the plan: “Explicitly, [the school board] would not discriminate against black children; implicitly, neither would it act on their behalf.”<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_how_2011"><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> For white families, the policy likely “added to racial anxiety”, as Baum notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parents could not know what a school’s makeup would be when classes started…. This uncertainty not only added to anxiety but also made leaving city public schools a choice with a more predictable outcome.“<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_how_2011"><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By 1960, a majority of students in Baltimore’s school district were black and many students still attended segregated schools. One-third of black students now attended formerly white schools. And although Baltimore’s approach to school desegregation avoided the racist reaction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_resistance">“massive resistance”</a>, in 1958, the Maryland State Commission on Interracial Problems observed that the problem “is not with violence but with the frigid withdrawal” of white residents from their black neighbors.<span class="citation" data-cites="orser_blockbusting_1994"><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>
<p>While some white Baltimoreans sought to promote integrated neighborhoods through groups like Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. (founded in 1959 by James Rouse, Ellsworth Rosen, and Sidney Hollander, Jr.), many more relocated to the still-segregated white communities in the suburbs. Between 1950 and 1960, the population of Baltimore County grew by over 80% (from 270,273 to 492,428). In the same ten year period, Baltimore City lost population (dropping from 949,708 to 939,024) while the proportion of African American residents grew (23.70% to 34.67%). Between 1960 and 1970, the population of Baltimore County continue to grow (26.12% to 621,077). Between 1950 and 1970, the population of Anne Arunel County, the population grew by more than 250% (117,392 in 1950 to 206,634 in 1960 to 297,539 in 1970).</p>

</figure>
<p>The movement of white Baltimoreans to the suburbs relied on federally-subsidized home mortgages (that African Americans could not get) and new highways for cars (that a smaller number of African Americans could afford to purchase). City leaders largely supported the transformation of the roads to accomodate suburban growth through the development of the Jones Falls Expressway (I-83), the planning of the Franklin-Mulberry Expressway, and the Baltimore Beltway (I-695) which opened in stages between 1955 and 1962.</p>
<p>Scholar Harold McDougall described how the federal and local policies supported the development of segregated suburbs in Baltimore and Anne Arundel Counties, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exclusionary zoning, though couched in terms of income rather than race, had the practical effect of reinforcing existing divisions along racial lines simply because if you were blacks could afford the suburban housing made more expensive by such regulations.<span class="citation" data-cites="mcdougall_black_1993"><a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Racialized suburban growth, or “white flight”, functioned as an implicit strategy of white resistance to integration. White resistance also included more explicit and, at times, violent responses by white people who sought to maintain the status quo and supported elected officials who ran on their opposition to the Civil Rights movement. White Baltimoreans in the city and suburbs voted in support of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace">George C. Wallace</a> (the segregationist Democratic Governor of Alabama) in the 1964 Democratic primary and for Barry Goldwater (a Republican Senator and opponent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) in that year’s general election. Hundreds of white residents attended segregationist rallies organized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_States%27_Rights_Party">National States’ Rights Party</a> in Patterson Park or Riverside Park in 1966.</p>
<p>In 1966, perennial candidate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P._Mahoney">George P. Mahoney</a> won an upset victory in the Democratic primary for Governor (receiving around 30% of the vote). In the general election, Mahoney based his campaign on his opposition to open housing with the slogan “Your home is your castle; protect it.”<span class="citation" data-cites="hardesty_veil_2009 hardesty_vodoo_2008"><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span> The controversy surrounding Mahoney’s racist campaign led a third independent candidate to enter the race which ended with the election of Spiro Agnew. Mahoney may have lost the election but his significant support in the Baltimore region illustrates the scale of white opposition to desegregation in this period.</p>

<p>The election year marked twelve years after the <em>Brown</em> decision and twenty-four years after the consequential March on Annapolis. Despite decades of unprecedented activism that overturned most of Maryland’s Jim and Jane Crow policies, African Americans in Baltimore continued to struggle against white resistance and racist policies, against employment discrimination, segregated and inadequate housing, unequal educational opportunities, and racist policing. The contradiction between the success of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore and Maryland with the continued challenges facing Baltimore’s black residents again drew the attention of national activists such as Martin Luther King and CORE with their designation of Baltimore as a “Target City” that summer.</p>
<p>Mayor Theodore McKeldin reflected on the city’s still limited progress Baltimore in June 1966:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In response to those who might say that we have made significant progress in the field of civil rights, I could say that I agree; but, I would also have to say that there are problems – important problems – which have thus far not been resolved; and I believe that this City can no longer delay meeting its responsibilities, both in the public and private sectors of community life. The fact is that while we have moved, we have not moved toward the solution of these problems with the speed and vigor with which we are capable. We have not really attempted, as a community, to understand the plight, the unrest, and the feelings of those who have been denied. We have not attempted to understand why, even after significant progress, our negro brethren still insist that all is not right nor community – that there is much to be done.<span class="citation" data-cites="mckeldin_state_1966"><a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many Baltimoreans, black and white, supported McKeldin’s commitment to continued progress on Civil Rights. In 1967, Mayoral candidate and City Council President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_D%27Alesandro_III">Thomas D’Alesandro III</a> defended busing as a strategy to relieve overcrowded schools. At his inauguration in December, D’Alesandro called “the city of hope” and. promised “to root out every cause or vestige of discrimination.”<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_how_2011"><a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> Unfortunately, as the next period of this study notes, D’Alesandro could not overcome these challenges in the ways he had hoped—stymied by the unrest following the assasination of Martin Luther King in 1968 among other factors.</p>
<p>In the following sections, this study continues to describe the buildings and landscapes associated with the movement and highlight three key topics that shaped Baltimore’s Civil Rights movement in this period:</p>
<ul>
<li>The desegregation of public schools and public accommodations</li>
<li>The changing mix of elected officials, public agencies, and activist organizations that shaped the Civil Rights movement</li>
<li>The transformation of housing and neighborhoods in the Baltimore region through racial transition, highway development, public housing and urban renewal projects</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="associated-places">Associated Places</h2>
<p>Baltimore’s Civil Rights movement was linked to a wide range of buildings, sites, structures, and landscapes during the during the 1950s and 1960s. These places include new buildings erected in the late 1940s and early 1950s, before <em>Brown</em>, in an attempt to resist inegration by creating “separate but equal” spaces for African Americans.</p>
<p>One example of a building that was built after <em>Brown</em> but reflects this same logic of a “separate but equal” facility is the Melvin Cade National Guard Armory where the state decided to maintain a segregated black National Guard unit and, in 1960, erected a new building for the unit at 2620 Winchester Street. The new building became a civic and social center for African American residents in West Baltimore, hosting dance parties, lectures, and neighborhood meetings throughout the 1960s and 1970s. After the death of Melvin H. Cade, commanding officer of the 229th Battalion of the Maryland National Guard, in 1964, the Guard renamed the building in his honor. Baltimore City listed the Armory as a local landmark in 2009.</p>
<p>After the decision, many places that had been previously segregated for African American residents fell into disuse; among them Pool No. 2 in Druid Hill Park and many former Colored School buildings. Other landmark buildings were demolished due to the expanding scope of local urban renewal projects. These included the Smith Hotel described by the <em>Sun</em>, at the time of the demolition in July 1957, as “almost a shrine to much of Baltimore’s Negro population.” The hotel was built in 1912 by Thomas R. Smith and served as a “gathering place for Negro visitors from as far north as New York and as far west as Chicago.”<span class="citation" data-cites="_smith_1957"><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In some locations, the association with the Civil Rights movement is as a site of protest like the Lexington Street “five-and-dimes” or Howard Street Department stores. The importance of these sites comes, in part, from their symbolic importance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The downtown department stores, as some of Baltimore’s most prominent sites of civic culture and modernity, were a principal target for anti-racist protests by individuals and organizations from the 1930s through the early 1960s.<span class="citation" data-cites="kramer_white_2003"><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other spaces, such as Patterson Park and Riverside Park, have associations with white resistance to the Civil Rights movement as the site of rallies in support of segregationist policies in 1966. In some cases, the connection is less direct but still present such as the network of midcentury developed alongside the “white flight” of this period or urban renewal projects such as State Center.</p>
<p>Finally, spaces for organizing, community building, and mutual support continued to be an important resource for both white and black activists. One example is Levering Hall at the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University. In 1953, Chester Wickwire accepted a position as the executive secretary of the campus YMCA and the chaplain for the university. At Levering Hall, Wickwire provided “a haven for liberals on an otherwise conservative campus” and ran “ran various student life programs such as concerts, dances, and movie screenings while simultaneously organizing political discussions about civil rights, pacifism, the Cold War, and Vietnam.” Wickwire himself was an active participant in the Civil Rights movement and helped support student activists.</p>
<p>Another example is the Arena Playhouse at 801 McCulloh Street occupied by the Arena Players, an African American theatre troupe, since 1962. Established in 1953 as an outgrowth of the “The Negro Little Theater”, the Arena Players spent a decade performing at varied locations including Coppin State University, the Druid Hill YMCA, the Great Hall Theater of St. Mary’s Church in Walbrook, and the Carl J. Murphy Auditorium at Morgan State University. After securing a long-term performance space, the Arena Players acquired the building in 1969 and through the 1970s continued to serve “as one of the only venues dedicated to showcasing the works of black playwrights and performers.”<span class="citation" data-cites="arena_players_inc_history"><a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>
<h2 id="desegregation-for-education-and-public-accommodations-after-brown">Desegregation for education and public accommodations after <em>Brown</em></h2>
<p>Activism around the desegregation of Baltimore’s public schools and public accomodations, such as parks, pools, and public-serving businesses, clearly predate the 1954 Supreme Court decision in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>.</p>
<p>Between 1938 and 1940, the Baltimore Urban League and NAACP joined in private negotiations with downtown department store owners and seeking to end their discriminatory policies against African American shoppers.<span class="citation" data-cites="kramer_white_2003"><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></span> Civil Rights leaders met again with a representative of the Retail Merchants Association in February 1943.<span class="citation" data-cites="kramer_white_2003"><a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span> In 1945, the <em>Afro-American</em> newspaper made a public push for change by naming specific downtown stores as “Orchids” or “Onions” depending on their treatment of African American shoppers.<span class="citation" data-cites="farrar_baltimore_1998"><a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></span> The 1930s and 1940s also saw legal and activist efforts to desegregation Baltimore’s public parks and recreational facilities.</p>
<p>In the late 1940s, Carl Murphy and Juanita Jackson Mitchell began pushing to desegregate Baltimore public schools and, in 1952, the NAACP and Thurgood Marshall successfully forced the city permit a small group of African American students to enroll at the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute.<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_how_2011 templeton_admission_1954 thomsen_integration_1983"><a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>
<p>However, the <em>Brown</em> decision pushed these issues to the forefront of the local debate and encouraged the years of activism that followed. The link between the Brown decision and the integration of public facilities stands out clearly in the opinion by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_and_City_Council_of_Baltimore_v._Dawson">Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Dawson</a></em> (1955):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is obvious that racial segregation in recreational activities can no longer be sustained as a proper exercise of the police power of the State; for if that power cannot be invoked to sustain racial segregation in the schools, where attendance is compulsory…it cannot be sustained with respect to public beach and bathhouse facilities, the use of which is entirely optional.<span class="citation" data-cites="schuster_city_2011"><a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For transportation, as well, the <em>Brown</em> decision was consequential. On November 7, 1955, the Interstate Commerce Commission similarly responded on the <em>Brown</em> decsion with the announcement that the “separate but equal doctrine was dead with respect to interstate transportation.”<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span> The 1956 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browder_v._Gayle">Browder v.

</figure>
<p>As noted in the introduction, unlike many other Southern cities and other jurisdictions in Maryland, the Baltimore City School Board responded quickly to the 1954 Supreme Court decision in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v.Board_of_Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a> by announcing a plan to end legal segregation. In contrast to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_resistance">“massive resistance”</a> seen elsewhere, representatives of nineteen “civic, religious, educational and labor groups” came together to form the Coordinating Council for Civic Unity and support the “peaceful opening of schools”.</p>
<p>But within a few years, after 1954, there were two trends in enrollment:</p>
<ul>
<li>a slow growing but moderate racial integration in the schools</li>
<li>a transition from a majority white to a majority black school district<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_how_2011"><a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></span></li>
</ul>
<p>By 1963, “28 Parents”, a group of both white and black parents presented a report to the school board describing how students continued to experience <em>de facto</em> segregation. The activists identified three contributing factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The construction of new schools in racially segregated neighborhoods; making a segregated student population more likely</li>
<li>The preference for enrolling neighborhood children when schools were “overcrowded”; again reinforcing existing patterns of segregation</li>
<li>Administrative actions to discourage integration. Baum notes, “Some white principals encouraged white parents to transfer their children out when black enrollment grew. Some principals reject black transfer applications to predominantly white schools.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Even within integrated schools, “ability tracking” separately black and white students within the building. The 28 Parents report highlighted a disturbing reality for CIvil Rights activists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a decade of legal segregation, most children attended class with majorities of their own race… By the time the board ended practices that limited choices, the desegregation policy had a ten-year history associated in the public mind with continuing segregation.“<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_how_2011"><a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Civil_Rights_Act">1964 Civil Rights Act</a> created a federal interest in desegregating schools encouraging the city to take further action. In 1966, Mayor McKeldin’s Task Force for Equal Rights began developing a plan for further action on school desegregation. His successor, Mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_D%27Alesandro_III">Thomas D’Alesandro III</a>, named Baltimore “Education City, USA” to highlight his commitment to supporting integrated and desirable schools.</p>
<h3 id="public-accommodations">Public accommodations</h3>
<p>The fight over public accomodations in Baltimore paralleled efforts in other segegated cities including transportation facilities (passenger railroad and ferries); public parks and recreational facilities (such as pools and recreation centers); and private businesses that were still open to the public (department stores, restaurants, hotels, etc.).</p>
<p>The discrimination African Americans faced in public accommodations was not just one of simple exclusion. Historian Paul A. Kramer notes that the discriminatory “racial practices” at Baltimore’s downtown department stores included three main aspects:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Discrimination in employment (only hired as maitenance or stockroom workers, elevator operators, porters, and restroom attendants; not higher-paying, higher-status jobs)</li>
<li>Refusal to serve African American customers at lunch counters</li>
<li>Policies prohibiting African American customers from trying on or returning clothing</li>
</ol>
<p>The prohibition on returns from African American customers (known as the “final sale” policy) reveals one of the fundamental motivation behind racial segregation: “anxieties and fears about physical contact between whites and blacks”. Kramer continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For most whites, blacks represented sources of unspecified physical and moral pollution … Black and white boadies might “touch” in the exchange of forks and plates at store lunch-counters. Even more threatening to whites was the possibility that the clothes they tried on or purchased might bear an invisible taint of black physical contact.<span class="citation" data-cites="kramer_white_2003"><a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notably, in early 1943, when the Baltimore NAACP sought to overturn the state’s Jim Crow laws, the repeal bill they supported was sent to state legislature <em>Hygine Committee</em> rather than <em>Judiciary Committee</em> for consideration.<span class="citation" data-cites="kramer_white_2003"><a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></span></p>
<p>One early challenge to these segregationist policies came in 1953 with an interracial group of CORE activists using sit-ins to protest segregated lunch counters (a strategy used previously in New York City in 1939 and by other CORE activists in Chicago in 1942). The success of their efforts was noted in the regular column of Mrs. B.M. Phillips (“If You Ask Me”) in the Afro-American Newspaper on November 7, 1953:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the Committee On Racial Equality, (CORE), the Urban league, and the Americans for Democratic Action, (ADA), more stores in the 200 block W. Lexington st. are realizing there is no color line in the dollars you spend. Lunch counters and restaurants in the Kresge and Woolworth Five and Ten have been serving all customers for several weeks. McCrory’s has just reversed its policy and will serve all comers […] Schulte United in the 200 block Lexington is still acting silly.<span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_if_1953"><a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The success, however, was limited. One 1955 survey found that 91% of 191 randomly-selected Baltimore businesses reported either the “exclusion” or “segregation” of blacks.<span class="citation" data-cites="kramer_white_2003"><a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></span> The annual report of the Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations also provided updates on discriminatory policies listing “places of public accommodations [that] are open to all” in March 1958.</p>
<p>As Phillips alludes in her column, the issue of public accomodation was often presented in terms of consumer politics. This made the issue personal for middle-class black activists like Mrs. Madeline W. Murphy who wrote to the Vice President of Hoschild Kohn in 1956 to say “not only [do I] feel equal to the average Hochschild Kohn’s consumers but I feel superior to them.” Such emphasis on racial equality as individual access made the desegregation of public accommodations “less of a challenge to traditional notions of racial equality” (in contrast to education, employment, and voting rights) and helped secure the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></span></p>
<p>CORE’s downtown campaign faded after the successful desegregation of the Read’s Drug Store lunch counter in January 1955. A new movement of students took up the cause on March 26, 1960 when black student activists from Morgan State University attempted to purchase food at department store restaurants at the Northwood Shopping Center and downtown. The student’s tried to purchase lunch at four downtown department stores. The succeeded at Hochschild Kohn; Sewart’s shut their food counters to all customers, white and black; Hutzler’s refused to serve a group of twenty students who waited for three hours before leaving.</p>
<p>The sit-ins continued through April 17, 1960, Easter Sunday when the <em>Sun</em> reported that Albert D. Hutzler met with Furman Templeton from the Urgan League, along with activists David Glenn and Robert B. Watts. After the meeting, Hutzler announced: “We have lifted restrictions. Negroes will be served in our restaurants.” Hecht-May and other downtown stores followed Hoschild Kohn and Hutzler’s with the change.</p>
<p>A large collection of letters sent to Hoschild Kohn after their policy change in late March 1960 reflect attitudes to desegration in the period. Interestingly, there are ten times the number of letters in support of integration but that is likely because activists saw the urgency of continuing the policy and saw integration as “frighteningly reversible.” Some opponents of desegregation described a rationale of “consumer choice”, as one woman wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you realize that by so doing [integrating], you are taking from the White Race any choice they had of segregation or integration when dining outside of their homes?<span class="citation" data-cites="kramer_white_2003"><a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others threatened to stay away from the downtown store, now that the policy of segregation had been abandoned. Paul Kramer notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>more than one of the racist critics wrote as self-conscious suburbanites, warning the downtown that integration would further provoke the flight of white residences and businesses. In the process, they revealed the extent to which the suburbs were imagined as racial islands still free of black “invasion”: downtown segregation was the only remaining draw that could pull whites in from their comfortable, newly-designed racial enclaves.<span class="citation" data-cites="kramer_white_2003"><a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notably, department stores had their own role in the suburban exodus with Hutzler’s stores in Towson (1952), Eastpoint (1956), Westview (1958); and Hoschild Kohn’s in Edmondson Village (1947). Civil Rights supporters also saw the importance of suburbanization in shaping the debate over public accomodation. In August 1957, a column in the <em>Afro</em> noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The big downtown stores and business have not welcomed colored people in the past… Their white only customers have moved to the suburbs and the colored customers they spurned are moving out too. So the heart of the city is no longer Lexington and Howard Sts.<span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_if_1957"><a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></span> <!-- FIXME: Double-check the citation above --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around the United States, the push for public accomodations continued in the 1950s, as a 2004 report from the National Historic Landmarks program describes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the 1950s, a number of northern and western states adopted legislation prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations. Joining the eighteen states with such laws already on the books were Oregon (1953), Montana (1955), New Mexico (1955), Vermont (1957), Maine (1957), Idaho (1959), and Alaska (1959). In 1961, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming brought the total number of states with anti-segregations statutes up to twenty-eight. In addition, several cities in states that did not have public accommodations laws passed their own versions, including Wilmington, Delaware; Baltimore, Maryland; St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri; and El Paso, Texas.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Baltimore, the City Council passed legislation ending segregated public accommodations in 1962.<span class="citation" data-cites="thompson_civil_1996"><a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></span> Maryland followed with a state law in January 1963.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></span> In late February 1964, the NAACP supported the Baltimore City Public Accommodations and Fair Employment Practice Ordinances which “guaranteed an end to lawful discrimination in ‘employment practices, educational institutions, places of public accommodation, resort or amusement, and health and welfare agencies.’”<span class="citation" data-cites="shoemaker_we_1994"><a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></span><!-- NOTE: It is unclear if this is different legislation than the 1962 law (or if the 1962 date referenced in Thompson is an error). --></p>
<h2 id="changes-for-elected-officials-and-activists">Changes for elected officials and activists</h2>
<p>The fast pace of change in this period came, in part, from major changes within the Civil Rights movement itself. Notable aspects of these changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The growth of an expanded interracial student movement</li>
<li>The rise of Black Power organizations</li>
<li>The growth of the women’s movement</li>
</ul>
<!-- Walter Lively should be briefly mentioned. His Freedom House on North Avenue -->
<p>On July 11, 1966, the Civic Interest Group (CIG) held a press conference at St. Peter Claver’s Catholic Church to publicly endorse black power and announce that “it would no longer avoid violence in cases of ‘self-defense’.” This shift by the participants in the Civil Rights student movement to emphasize By the mid 1960s, white participants in the student movement began to shift to focus on anti-Vietnam War activism.</p>
<p>The Black Power movement emerged during this period and helped to bring new national attention to Civil Rights issues in Baltimore. This change took place at both the national and local level, exemplified by the founding of the Black Panther Party and the advocacy efforts of CORE in the late 1960s.</p>
<p>From July 1 to July 4 1964, the Congress of Racial Equality held their national convention in Baltimore. CORE focused national attention on Baltimore again in 1966 when they announced Baltimore as the organization’s first “Target City.” Walter Lively, a CORE organizer, continued to work as an advocate for community development and Civil Rights organizing in Baltimore through U-JOIN and other organizations through the 1980s.</p>
<!-- NOTE: On October 1, 1966, the Black Panther Party was founded in Oakland. -->
<h2 id="housing">Housing</h2>
<p>The key issues around housing in this period were the racial transition of Baltimore neighborhoods from segregated white to black and clearance of black neighborhoods through urban renewal, transportation projects, and other related land use projects.</p>
<!-- NOTE: In 1954, Baltimore began allowing integration in public housing. In 1964, the Baltimore Housing Study Advisory Committee produced a report.[@baltimore_city_housing_study_advisory_committee_report_1964] -->
<h3 id="neighborhood-racial-transition-after-1954">Neighborhood racial transition after 1954</h3>
<p>The issue of racial transition reached Edmondson Village around 1955, when the first black residents moved west of the Gwynns Falls to live in the southeast corner of the region, around the western end of the Baltimore Street Bridge. One white resident remarked on the experience to historian Ed Orser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the [black] people started moving into the neighborhood, they did come in, literally block by block. I can recall when they came across the… bridge, everybody was very upset; they said, ‘Oh my God, they’re over the bridge now; our street will be next.’<span class="citation" data-cites="orser_blockbusting_1994"><a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In July 1958, Allendale-Lyndhurst improvement Association president L.E. Larsen gave the association’s support to a plan sponsored by the Baltimore Urban League, the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations, and the Citizens Planning and Housing Association to “combat the conversion of Baltimore areas from all-white to all-Negro occupancy.” Larsen observed that Edmondson Village:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>already faced with pressure from block-busting realtor tactics and population shifts… the exodus from the city of the stable core of responsible citizens will likely be accelerated and the inevitable consequences will be a set-back to many of the long-range plans now being developed and implemented.<span class="citation" data-cites="_population_1958"><a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></span></p>

<h4 id="african-american-residents-move-west-of-the-gwynns-falls">1955: African American residents move west of the Gwynns Falls</h4>
<p>The issue reached Edmondson Village around 1955, when the first black residents moved west of the Gwynns Falls to live in the southeast corner of the region, around the western end of the Baltimore Street Bridge. One white resident remarked on the experience, commenting to Dr. Ed Orser:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the [black] people started moving into the neighborhood, they did come in, literally block by block. I can recall when they came across the… bridge, everybody was very upset; they said, “Oh my God, they’re over the bridge now; our street will be next.”<span class="citation" data-cites="orser_blockbusting_1994"><a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In April 1958, the improvement group organized their annual meeting at School No. 88 located at Wildwood Parkway and Gelston Drive, hosting Chief Judge Delany Foster of the Orphans Court of Baltimore as the guest speaker. In July 1958, Association president L.E. Larsen gave the association’s support to a plan sponsored by the Baltimore Urban League, the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations, and the Citizens Planning and Housing Association to “combat the conversion of Baltimore areas from all-white to all-Negro occupancy.” Larsen observed that Edmondson Village:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>already faced with pressure from block-busting realtor tactics and population shifts… the exodus from the city of the stable core of responsible citizens will likely be accelerated and the inevitable consequences will be a set-back to many of the long-range plans now being developed and implemented.<span class="citation" data-cites="_population_1958"><a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An African American resident in this period later shared her experience in an oral history with Dr. Ed Orser, remarking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we first moved to the neighborhood, it was more white – we were just about the second black family on this block… We could see the changes, because when we moved, there were so many sale signs all around, and it did make a difference in the neighborhood, because there was a change, and you had to get yourself adjusted to the people who were moving in, and you couldn’t really know the ones who were moving out, because they were leaving so fast, so we were really going through a transitional stage. People were moving in and out overnight; you didn’t really know who your neighbors were. It was a difficult period, because when we moved, we thought maybe the neighborhood would be stabilized; it just wasn’t.<span class="citation" data-cites="orser_blockbusting_1994"><a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By 1960, however, the area south of Edmondson Village had changed from more than 99% white in 1950 to 62% black in 1960 and, a decade later, 92% black in 1970. Edmondson Village itself remained 99% white in 1960 but had changed to 97% black by 1970.<span class="citation" data-cites="orser_blockbusting_1994"><a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Although Baltimore did not see widespread physical violence on a scale comparable to white antagonists in Detroit or Chicago, the State Commission on Interracial Problems observed in 1958, “The problem it said, is not with violence ‘but with the frigid withdrawal’ of whites from the Negroes.” During the late 1950s, the State Commission and others finally engaged with the ongoing process of racial transition with the beginning of advocacy and organizing efforts to promote “neighborhood stabilization.”</p>
<h3 id="urban-renewal-transportation-and-land-use">Urban renewal, transportation, and land use</h3>
<p>In 1956, the state selected the Mount Royal area as an urban renewal site for the development of the State Center office complex.</p>
<!-- According to [Indyreader](https://indyreader.org/content/history-housing-policy-and-segregation-baltimore)

> In the period between 1950 and 1964, Baltimore embarked on an aggressive urban renewal program that displaced more than 25,000 people, 85% of them African-American.  In 1953, the City's Redevelopment Commission designated eight areas of the city to be redeveloped, including urban renewal projects in Waverly and the area just west of Johns Hopkins Hospital.  In Waverly, a residential and commercial project that included 290 apartments and 270 parking spaces was designated by the Redevelopment Commission for white occupants only. -->
<!-- QUESTION:How to talk about the rise of black power and the changes that CORE and the Black Panther Party brought to Civil Rights in Baltimore? How to talk about city and state politics? How did approaches to organizing in the Civil Rights movement change during this period? Does this period represent a move away from interracial organizing? What role did anti-communism play in that change? -->
<!-- TODO: Do we try to incorporate information on police brutality into this section of the text? -->
<!-- 

## Police Brutality

In July 1967, again according to [Baltimore Police History](http://baltimorecitypolicehistory.com/), the Baltimore City Police established the first of four "Community Relations Store Front Operations" noting, "The purpose of these centers is to reach the community on an intimate basis. This was the first such project in the Northeastern region of the United States."

>"A society that refuses to give some of its people equal rights and opportunities creates frustrations whose brunt is thrown at the police because they are the obvious protectors of an unjust order." Bayard Rustin speaking in Baltimore (from Baltimore Community Relations Commission report, 1966 or 67)
