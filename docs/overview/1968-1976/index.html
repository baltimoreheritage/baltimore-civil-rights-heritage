        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A week of unrest on the streets of Baltimore followed the assassination of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968. Some local residents and elected officials saw the unrest as a wake up call sounding an urgent demand for aggressive action on Civil Rights. However, others used the unrest as the pretext to pursue a reactionary agenda opposing expanded opportunities for black Baltimoreans. While activists had succeeded in overturning many of the city, state, and federal policies that required racial segregation and protected discrimination, the legacy of these policies continued to have major consequences for black Baltimoreans and for historically segregated black neighborhoods. Activist worked to shift the debate over Civil Rights to focus on community development. However, they struggled against the apathy of white elected officials at the local level and antipathy of federal officials, such as President Richard Nixon who, in 1972, radically cut funding for the President Lyndon B. Johnson’s “War on Poverty” programs. Moreover, the celebrated “peaceful” desegregation of Baltimore’s public schools proved completely inadequate to sustain integration given a region where housing policies in the city and suburb promoted growing residential segregation in the 1960s and 1970s. This introduction continues to describe the immediate consequences of the April 1968 unrest, the political landscape for Civil Rights at the federal and local level in this period, and changes in population across the region.</p>
<p>On Thursday, April 4, 1968, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated</a> in Memphis, Tennessee. The following day, unrest broke out in Detroit and D.C. Three hundred people gathered in Baltimore for a peaceful memorial service on the morning of Saturday, April 6. That afternoon, however, some residents began to attack properties in East Baltimore and fires soon broke out at multiple locations. The unrest spread quickly and continued through Thursday, April 11.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, April 9, 1968, Maryland Governor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a> invited one hundred of Baltimore’s black leaders to meet at the State Center Office Building. Agnew used the meeting to deliver a one-sided lecture and charge the participants with “responsibility for the riots”. Most of the activists in attendance walked out. Some drafted an “angry rebuttal” observing, “Agnew’s actions are more in keeping with the slave system of a bygone era.” They noted that by separating “good” moderates from “bad” militants (what Agnew perjoratively labeled the “circuit-riding, Hanoi-visiting type of leader”), the governor sought to divide black activists from one another. One minister observed: “He’s forcing us all to become militants.”<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_how_2011"><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> In a vivid example of the political divisions among local residents, however, hundreds of white Baltimoreans sent telegraphs to Agnew’s office—most praising his attack on Baltimore’s black leaders. One stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Thankful to hear that the white people still have a strong voice in government.”<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_how_2011"><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the end of the week, it was clear to everyone that the unrest had left thousands of residents reeling from the damage. Police arrested 5,512 people (nearly all of them black; totaling about one in every seventy-five black residents). At the height of the response, 12,000 troops occupied the city (one for every seventy-five city residents). Six hundred people were injured (fifty police officers among them). The city saw 1,208 major fires and 1,049 businesses damaged. Six people were killed—all African American.<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_how_2011"><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span><!-- TODO: Double-check that the six people killed in the 1968 unrest are all African American. --></p>
<p>While the factors that shaped the Civil Rights movement over the next decade existed before the 1968 unrest, the events of that April framed the uncertain future of the movement and Baltimore’s segregated African American neighborhoods for both white and black residents. From 1968 through the mid 1970s, the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore was shaped by both a renewed progressive vision for reinvestment in historically segregated black neighborhoods and a reactionary withdrawal continuing the pattern of “white flight” that followed World War II. These factors are seen in both the politics of the period, the movement of people, and the buildings and spaces they used.</p>
<p>Across the nation, people witnessed an aggressive reaction against the Civil Rights movement. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Republican_National_Convention">1968 Republican National Convention</a> offered a previes of these reversals when Agnew’s patronizing lecture of Baltimore’s black activists won him the nomination as Vice President to Richard Nixon. The selection reinforced the Republican party’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy">southern strategy</a> which sought win the support of conservative white voters inspired to racist reaction by the Civil Rights policies of incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Democratic Party. Following Nixon’s landslide reelection in 1972, his administration made sharp cuts to funding for urban areas and War on Poverty programs. The cuts have had lasting consequences for urban renewal and transportation projects in Baltimore’s historically segregated black neighborhoods—a topic addressed in greater depth in this study’s look at community development.<!-- NOTE: Citations missing! --></p>
<p>At the local and state level, political leaders were not always explicitly antagonistic to Civil Rights activists but were often apathetic or indifferent. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_L._J._D%27Alesandro_III">Mayor Thomas D’Alesandro III</a>, who had won office in 1967 as a strong supporter of the Civil Rights movement, decided not to run for a second term. Mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Donald_Schaefer">William Donald Schaefer</a> took office in 1971, beginning a sixteen year period as Mayor, but took a largely passive role on Civil Rights issues during his term in office. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Mandel">Marvin Mandel</a> became Governor in 1969 after Agnew’s resignation to serve as Vice President. While praised for his appointment of black judges and relationships with black business leaders (including William Adams, Henry Parks Jr. and Raymond Haysbert of the Park Sausage Company), Mandel similarly avoided taking strong positions on Civil Rights issues.<span class="citation" data-cites="williams_jr._mandels_2015"><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> In one example, both Mayor Schaefer and Governor Mandel continued to support Baltimore City Police Commisioner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Pomerleau">Donald Pommerlau</a> even after a Maryland State Senate investigation in 1976 revealed that over the previous decade Pommerlau had created the Inspectional Services Division (ISD) and spied on Civil Rights activists, including Congressional Representative Parren Mitchell.<!-- NOTE: Citation missing! --> <!-- TODO: Consider incorporating this passage: Revelations such as the ISD and the instability of local leadership (the Baltimore City School board, for example, went through a large number of directors in this period) led to a broad loss of trust in public institutions and elected officials among many Baltimore residents. NOTE: Citation missing! --></p>
<p>Baltimore’s City Council offered some hope for Civil Rights activists seeking greater political power. A contested redistricting process in early 1971 led to more opportunities for black candidates to win election to the City Council.<span class="citation" data-cites="price_3rd_bard_1971 price_3rd_negro_1971 price_3rd_districting_1971"><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> By October, anticipating the election based on the results of the Democratic primary, the <em>Sun</em> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Baltimore City Council, an exclusively Democratic province since before World War II, seem likely to be controlled for the first time by a coalition of liberal whites and Negroes no matter what the outcome of the general election.<span class="citation" data-cites="_negro-white_1971"><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But even as black elected officials won greater control over the city government and, perhaps, a greater share of the city’s economic opportunities, the city itself experienced a precipitous drop in total population. Between 1970 and 1980, Baltimore City lost over 110,000 residents. At the same time, African American residents became a majority of the city’s population. Despite this overall decline, the period still saw the construction of many new school buildings and recreation centers as the city replaced what many saw as aging, out-dated facilities.<!-- TODO: This last sentence may be a bit extraneous here. --></p>

<p><!-- NOTE: What happened to poverty and employment in this period? How does the city deal with job loss and revenue loss? --></p>
<p>The following sections document the significance of these changes and their relationship to places associated with the Civil Rights movement. After reviewing the range of associated places in this period, this study covers several themes in more detail including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The changing leadership and organization of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore. How was the movement shaped by Black Power? How did the movement intersect with social movements for feminism, LGBTQ rights, disability rights, and others?</li>
<li>The shift by Civil Rights activists to focus on community and economic development. How did approaches to community development address the legacies of segregation and discrimination? How did people reinvest in historically segregated neighborhoods?

<!-- NOTE: What places were demolished in this period? How were black communities in Baltimore County affected by the development of I-695 and other suburban projects? -->
<p>The places associated with the Civil Rights movement in this period include private homes adopted by radical activist organizations, unassuming buildings put to use for community organizing by city agencies, and new buildings erected in an effort to promote economic opportunity for black Baltimoreans. In contrast to earlier periods, where buildings such as churches or homes for activists developed long-term associations with the Civil Rights movement, many of these buildings were only associated with the movement for a brief period. In addition, the expanding scope of demolition under continuing “urban renewal” efforts in this period led to the loss of a number of significant structures. Another novel aspect of this period is the emerging importance of preservation and public history in preserving and interpreting buildings associated with African American history.</p>
<p>Examples of buildings associated with Civil Rights activist groups include the numerous structures used by the Baltimore Branch of the Black Panther Party between the earliest organization of the chapter in 1968 and group’s end in 1972. In that short period, the group organized classes, community support activities, and protests at dozens of different buildings and locations. The group initially grew out of the Soul School located at 522 North Fremont Street near the George P. Murphy Homes. The first formal chapter headquarters was a house at 1209 North Eden Street and the members began organizing free breakfast and lunch programs at nearby St .Vincent’s D. Poore’s Church (formerly St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church; in 2017, occupied as Sweet Prospect Baptist Church). By 1970, the headquarters (also referenced as a “Black Community Information Center”) had moved to a rented house at 1248 N. Gay Street.<span class="citation" data-cites="holter_vanguard_2017 mccutchen_black_2004"><a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Other buildings are associated with public agencies, such as the Community Action Agency, the Model Cities Agency and the Baltimore Urban Services Agency, all directed by Lenwood Ivey, and their effort to connect to the needs of Baltimore residents by bringing services out into city neighborhoods.<span class="citation" data-cites="faust_neighborhood_2015"><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span> Aiden Faust describes the network of twenty-three neighborhood centers writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These centers were distributed across the city, with higher concentrations in East and West Baltimore, where the poorest neighborhoods were (and still are) concentrated. The centers occupied repurposed churches, storefronts, libraries, public baths, or (in the case of Dunbar) associated with an existing public high school. These diverse settings served as multipurpose centers for many programs and classes for children, teens, senior citizens, young mothers, the homeless, and families in crisis. Food pantries, yoga classes, poetry readings, dance performances, legal assistance, home heating assistance, library services, and many more programmatic offerings coexisted in these spaces.<span class="citation" data-cites="faust_neighborhood_2015"><a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to these neighborhood centers, Model Cities established six “Community Councils” which became seen as “centers of black political activity” and were “eyed with concern by City Councilmen and the local media.” Consequently, in 1976, Lenwood Ivey shut down the Community Councils, a controversial decision that was “decidedly unpopular with residents and Council staff.”<span class="citation" data-cites="faust_neighborhood_2015"><a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>

<p>The shifting expectations of how Civil Rights activism took shape also affected some of the places with long-established associations with the Civil Rights movement, such as in June 1968, when Rev. Walter L. Hildebrand, the new pastor at Bethel AME Church, affirmed the church’s plans to make the church “of utmost service to the poor, the hopeless and the oppressed.”<span class="citation" data-cites="oliver_new_1968"><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Public buildings could be sites of conflict in other ways. For example, in August 1968, the Upton Planning Committee threatened a boycott of Lafayette Market (now known as the Avenue Market) on Pennsylvania Avenue in a successful effort to force improvements in the conditions of the market.<span class="citation" data-cites="_boycott_1968"><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Civil Rights organizing also took place in buildings associated with the peace movement and other radical political and social movements. One example is the Peace Action Center at 2525 Maryland Street described by Amy E. Zanoni as the “locus for the city’s antiwar movement”. The provided office and meeting space for the Baltimore Defense Committee and <em>Peace and Freedom News</em>, “Baltimore’s first underground newspaper”, along with a mimeograph machine and a paid full-time staff person, Gren Whitman, whose salary was funded by a “progressive peace tax paid by the BDC’s members.”<span class="citation" data-cites="zanoni_working_2013"><a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Businesses and institutions also responded to the currents of Civil Rights activism. One notable example the business established by Charles Thurgood Burns (1915-1991) in 1970 when he took over the bankrupt “Super Jet Market” located on East Chase Street. Renaming the business Super Pride, he restored the business to profitability within three years—despite encountering some food companies that refused to work with a black-owned store. Burns had started in the grocery business around 1921 delivering groceries for the small store his grandfather owned on Dolphin Street. He sold vegetables, produce and fish out of the back of a cart during high school and college then later became the co-owner of Hilton Court Chain of Ethical Pharmacies – a business that according to Burns’ obituary, “catered to the needs of black consumers at a time when white-owned businesses ignored them.”<span class="citation" data-cites="robinson_charles_1991"><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></span> Between 1970 and 1990, Super Pride grew to seven locations, employing more than 400 people, and making over $43 million in annual sales. Under Burns’ leadership, Super Pride sponsored Black History Month activities and supported the Arena Players. By the late 1990s, however, the business struggled to compete against national chains and the city’s shrinking population. In the fall of 2000, Super Pride closed all eight of its locations and, in November, held an auction to liquidate the stores and their remaining equipment to satisfy creditors.<span class="citation" data-cites="sentementes_super_2000"><a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Other black-owned businesses found success in marketing traditional southern cooking as “soul food” among including Sampson’s located at 944 W. Fayette Street, the Red Rooster Restaurant and Lounge at 1801 McKean Avenue, and The Yellow Bowl on Greenmount Avenue. According to one 1973 article, soul food was also a regular offering at many of the around two hundred storefront churches active in the early 1970s.<span class="citation" data-cites="pietila_storefront_1973"><a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Another example is found in a March 1971 <em>Sun</em> profile of pharmacist Donald A. Schumer and his investment in a new building at Pennsylvania Avenue and Dolphin Street for the forty-year-old Penn-Dol Pharmacy.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>. The report noted Schumer’s sale of the the store’s “sundries section to several black employees who had been with him for a number of years” and observed, “The interior of the pharmacy resembles the orderly kind of drug store one expects to find in the affluent white suburbs.”<span class="citation" data-cites="_white_1971"><a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In this same period, a large number of buildings associated with African American history in Baltimore were demolished to make way for transportation and “urban renewal projects”. Between 1973 and 1977, nine hundred and seventy one rowhouses and sixty-two businesses came down to make way for the partial construction of the East-West Expressway.<span class="citation" data-cites="dilts_3-road_1973"><a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span> Hundreds more fell for the construction of Martin Luther King Boulevard beginning in 1976.<span class="citation" data-cites="dilts_residents_1975"><a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></span> In 1971, the city tore down the much-beloved Royal Theatre on Pennsylvania Avenue. One 1986 account, recalled the Royal as “the brightest gem along the cultural and business strip that made Pennsylvania Avenue the nucleus of Baltimore’s black community from the 1920s through the 1960s”. The author attributed the theatre’s decline to both the integration of other theatres in Baltimore in the 1960s and the competition from the opening of the Civic Centre (now the Baltimore Arena) in 1962.<span class="citation" data-cites="giuliano_royal_1986"><a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This trend saw resistance both from anti-highway activists and from black Baltimoreans seeking to preserve historic places associated with African American history in Baltimore. In some cases, they found allies with the Baltimore Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation (CHAP) established in 1964, the Maryland Historical Trust (MHT) established in 1966, and the Commission on Negro History and Culture (later renamed the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture (MCAAHC)) established in 1969.</p>
<!-- NOTE: This section could mention the A.B. Koger Resource Library, headquarters of the Commission on the Study of Negro History and Culture, 12 W. Madison Street. In 1972, moved to Morgan State. -->
<p>The most prominent of these early efforts was the Committee for the Preservation of Orchard Street Church, organized in the fall of 1972 and led by Mrs. W.A.C. Hughes.<span class="citation" data-cites="_historic_1972 _old_1973 pietila_black_1974 arnett_church_1976"><a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span> The National Register of Historic Places provided an important tool for recognizing and protecting African American landmarks including Orchard Street United Methodist Church (designated November 12, 1975), Public School No. 111 at N. Carrollton Avenue and Riggs Road (designated September 25, 1979), Cummins Memorial Church (1210 W. Lanvale Street) (designated October 31, 1979), and the Sharp Street Memorial United Methodist Church and Community House (designated July 21, 1982). Cleary, these efforts do not end in 1976 but continue up through the present. In the 1970s, CHAP designated several local landmarks associated with African American history in Baltimore including Bethel A.M.E. Church and Ebenezer A.M.E. Church in 1971 and Sharon Baptist Church (1373 N. Stricker Street) and First Baptist Church (525 N. Caroline Street) in 1977. CHAP designated Madison Park as the city’s first historic district occupied largely by African American residents also in 1977.</p>

<p>Other cultural organizations also changed to reflect rising black political and social power. One example is the Negro War Heroes Monument commissioned in 1968 and installed at Monument Square on Calvert Street, despite some opposition, in 1971.<span class="citation" data-cites="keidel_monument_1968 _protests_1971"><a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></span> Another example is found at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, Branch 17 (known at present as the Pennsylvania Avenue Branch library) where librarians organized a program on Langston Hughes in the summer of 1969:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest attractions at Branch 17 are books on job opportunities and books about Negro history and culture. Miss Lillie Story, administrative assistant at the branch, said that the big increase in demand for the latter books has come since the 1968 Baltimore riots.<span class="citation" data-cites="arnett_evening_1969"><a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></span></p>

<!-- NOTE: How were black and white Baltimore residents effected by the Civil Rights movement and related issues? How about in the suburbs? -->
<p>To a remarkable degree, this period saw radical changes in the structure and aims of the Civil Rights movement. The huge legislative and judicial accomplishments of the movement between 1954 and 1968, along with the identification of the movement with some of the most visisble and memorable figures, sometimes leads people to assume that the movement ended in 1968.</p>
<p>While the movement did not end, this period resulted in major transformations among the individual leadership and the organizational structure. The movement also helped to inspire a wide range of related social movement that, in turn, shaped local and national history in major ways. These related movements, including feminism, LGBTQ rights, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_rights_movement">disability rights</a>, and Native rights, had, of course, been present for decades but were accorded much greater visisibility in this period.</p>
<!-- NOTE: Has anyone already researched the history of the disability rights movement or Native rights movement in Baltimore or Maryland? -->
<h3 id="changes-for-individual-leadership-within-the-movement">Changes for individual leadership within the movement</h3>
<p>The people and organizations that supported Civil Rights activism in Baltimore experienced major changes in the late 1960s and 1970s. These changes reflected broader changes in the movement driven, in part, by the new access black residents and activists had to formal institutions.</p>
<p>One notable example of these changes is the 1969 election of Enolia McMillan as president of the Baltimore Branch of the NAACP. McMillan’s election won an upset victory over Juanita Jackson Mitchell, who sought the post after her mother, Lillie M. Jackson, stepped down after serving thirty four years as president of the group.<span class="citation" data-cites="brewington_enolia_2006"><a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This period was marked by the passing of an earlier generation of local Civil Rights leaders, many of whom remained active in local politics up until their death. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_L._Templeton">Dr. Furman Templeton</a>, the executive director of the Baltimore Urban League since 1950, died on February 12, 1970.<span class="citation" data-cites="_dr._1970"><a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></span> Physician and long-time activist Dr. John Camper died on Nov 21, 1977.<span class="citation" data-cites="_physician_1977"><a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></span></p>
<p>African American Baltimoreans found new opportunities in private businesses. In 1968, Maryland National (Baltimore’s largest bank) appointed E. Thomas Williams as the bank’s first black manager.<span class="citation" data-cites="jones_black_1976"><a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Oher prominent activists and organizers in this period included Walter Percival Carter (1923 - d. July 31, 1971).<span class="citation" data-cites="_rites_1971"><a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></span> Aiden Faust describes Carter’s significant legacy writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walter Percival Carter was a social worker and civil rights activist who led Baltimore’s chapter of the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE), organized voter registration drives and freedom rides, served as Maryland’s coordinator for the 1963 March on Washington, and was involved with protests to desegregate employment at Baltimore Gas and Electric, Gwynn Oak amusement park, and Howard Johnson hotels.<span class="citation" data-cites="faust_neighborhood_2015"><a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the chief community organizer for Baltimore’s Model Cities agency, Carter shows how many activists transitioned in this period to work within local and state government rather than solely on the outside. These changes affected not only activists but other black Baltimoreans as well. By 1971, African American workers held 46% of the 41,000 municipal jobs in Baltimore City including some key leadership positions. <!-- NOTE: Citation missing! --></p>
<p>Linwood Ivey is another example of a public employee and administrator whose work sought to serve the broader goals of the Civil Rights movement. Originally appointed as the director of the Community Action Agency (CAA), Ivey continued to lead the succeeeding Model City Agency (MCA), and the Ubran Services Agency (USA).<span class="citation" data-cites="faust_neighborhood_2015"><a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In July 1971, Ronald N. Patterson, previously a resident of Seattle, came to Baltimore to serve as the first black school superintendent.<span class="citation" data-cites="sartain_borders_2013"><a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></span></p>
<!-- NOTE: That same year, a group of African American Baltimore City police officers founded their own organization the Vanguard Justice Society. What was the purpose of this organization? Who were the members? In 1984, Mayor Schaefer appointed the first black police commissioner. -->
<p>Others went from public workers to hold elected office. Charles Blount, a former principal at Dunbar High School, served on the Community Action Commission in 1968 and won election to the Maryland State Senate in 1971. Later, in 1985, Blount resigned from the board of the Urban Services Agency to protest the regressive cuts and policy changes affecting the organization.<span class="citation" data-cites="faust_neighborhood_2015"><a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></span></p>
<p>On January 3, 1971, Parren Mitchell took office as the first black member of the U.S. Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction. Mitchell had experience advocating for Civil Rights within and outside of government. From 1963 to 1965 he was executive secretary of the Maryland Human Relations Commission, overseeing implementation of the state’s public accommodations law. Mitchell then became director of the Baltimore Community Action Agency, an anti-poverty program, from 1965 to 1968, when he resigned and returned to Morgan State as a professor of sociology and assistant director of its Urban Affairs Institute. In 1969, he became the President of Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. where he continued through 1970. Parren Mitchell was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1970 served seven succeeding terms from January 3, 1971 through January 3, 1987.</p>

<p>White activists and allies also played a significant role in this period. Walter Sondheim, for example, was hailed as a “civic leader” for his management of the desegration of Baltimore’s public schools and downtown urban renewal efforts.<span class="citation" data-cites="dorsey_prolific_1975"><a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 id="changes-for-activist-organizations">Changes for activist organizations</h3>
<p>In many of the neighborhoods where African American households were buying homes they could never have purchased a decade earlier, black middle-income residents<!-- NOTE: What proporition of this new cohort of residents were middle v. low-income? Who participated in resident organizing in the 1950s? --> organized a new set of community groups that played an important role in local debates over school segregation, housing, and community development policy. One example of this type of organization is the Evergreen Protective Association representing a neighborhood located within the Edmondson Avenue National Register Historic District. The organization made a lifetime membership donation to the NAACP in the early 1960s. Their commitment to civil rights activism included providing “sandwiches, coffee and milk” along with the League of Women Voters and the Dunbar PTA, to students from Dunbar High School engaged in a sit-in at the Baltimore Department of Education in the spring of 1964.<!-- Citation missing! --></p>
<!-- NOTE: Insert example about the City Fair! -->
<p>The Baltimore City Fair provided another way these new organizations connected around shared interests and concerns. In 1970, Hope Quackenbush, the first executive director of the Baltimore City Fair, remarked that the event was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>intended to showcase to the entire Baltimore population the true strengths of a city determined to solve its problems, to help neighborhoods help themselves and to capture the flavor of a fascinating and exciting city […] In place of the traditional exposition of agriculture one finds at a county fair, our fair will display the product of the city, its people and its culture. Each participating neighborhood will have on display the elements that make it unique and special […] The participating neighborhoods will come from every corner of Baltimore—restoration communities, black communities, ethnic communities, garden communities, golden age communities—all presenting one message, We are Baltimore. (<a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-09-25/news/0009250207_1_baltimore-city-fair-baltimore-symphony-orchestra">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this same time, Baltimore saw the expansion of anti-poverty and Black Power organizations with a distinct agenda from older Civil Rights organizations seen as advancing an agenda focused on middle-class concerns. At the national level these changes are illustrated by the founding of the Black Panthers in Oakland in October 1966 and the rise of the Nation of Islam in the 1950s and 1960s. Local examples include tenants and welfare rights organizations such as Mother Rescuers (whose development is chronicled in detail by historian Rhonda Williams) and the Soul School.<span class="citation" data-cites="williams_politics_2004 williams_pursuit_2010"><a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></span> Historian Amy Zanoni describes this change, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A significant aspect of this move toward addressing structural problems entailed the formation of student groups like Baltimore’s U-JOIN, headed by Lively, and CORE, which engaged in anti-poverty activism, understanding it as central to anti-racist struggles, in the early 1960s. U-JOIN was founded by members of Baltimore SDS as part of its Emergency Rehabilitation Assistance Project (ERAP) and included students from Hopkins, Goucher, and Morgan, as well as non-students and people that dropped out of school to fight for social justice. ERAP, according to Rhonda Williams, was “hoping to build an ‘interracial movement’ by galvanizing poor people at the grass roots around issues such as housing, schools, medical care, and food insecurity.”<span class="citation" data-cites="zanoni_working_2013"><a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></span></p>

<p>The Black Panthers struggled in Baltimore in large part due to a campaign of harrassment and surveillance by the FBI and the Baltimore City Police Department.<span class="citation" data-cites="holter_vanguard_2017 conway_marshall_2011"><a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></span> Paul Coates, a member of the Black Panther Party in Baltimore described the role of the organization between early 1969 and late 1972:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought that the party was doing things that would have an impact on the lives of black people. It seemed like a good vehicle. When I came in, I had only a limited basis for understanding the world. I just knew it was fucked up. But I had no perspective, no point of view. No process for sorting out the significance of the things I was seeing and experiencing, no process for validating my views against those of other people. In the party I began to develop my own system of political understanding. The party had a structure in place to encourage political education. He provided a setting where I could interact with people who are searching for answers, and with some who thought they knew the answers.<span class="citation" data-cites="mcdougall_black_1993"><a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- NOTE: What should we say about the arrest of Marshall "Eddie" Conway on April 23, 1970? -->
<p>New black Civil Rights organizations prompted similar reconfigurations of how white allies approached their efforts to support the Civil Rights movement locally and nationally. For example, the largely white Baltimore Committee for Political Freedom “formed because of fear that the local police were planning to assassinate Black Panther Party leaders in the city.”<span class="citation" data-cites="mcdougall_black_1993"><a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></span> The group’s membership included:</p>

<li>William Zinman, attorney for the Maryland ACLU</li>
<li>Rev. Chester Wickwire, white minister</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the Black Power movement also, arguably, exacerbated internal divisions within the Civil Rights movement especially around class. In November 1968, attorney and activist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florynce_Kennedy">Florynce Kennedy</a> delivered a keynote address for Woman Power’s 11th annual Leadership Conference at the Belvedere Hotel in Mount Vernon that discouraged voting for mainstream political party candidates and warned “middle-class Negroes” to “watch your tail while trying to climb on the big white ship.” According to an account by Lula Jones Garrett in the AFRO, “Her audience sat shocked, with stiff shoulders, pursed lips and raised eyebrows as they listened.”<span class="citation" data-cites="_at_1968"><a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></span></p>

<h4 id="feminist-movement">Feminist movement</h4>
<p>The growth of the feminist movement at a national level brought new opportunities for African American women in Baltimore during this period and focused attention on sexism within the Civil Rights movement and racism within the feminist movement. The necessity of addressing both racial and gender discrimination and inequality was clear to Victorine Adams, then a member of the Baltimore City Council, in her 1971 remarks to a class of students at Morgan State University as she cited a “white political power structure [that] did not listen to black people” and “black politicians who paid their women no mind” as the inspiration for fouding the Colored Women’s Democratic Club (first organized in 1946) and Woman Power, Inc. (organized by 1957).<span class="citation" data-cites="_people_1971"><a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The late 1960s and early 1970s saw major changes for national policies affecting women. On October 13, 1967, President Lyndon B.

<p>Activists organized at the national level as in 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) organized in Washington, DC and, in 1973, the National Black Feminist Organization formed in New York. At the local level, one of the urgent issues that women organized around was access to contraception, family planning services, and health services for women. <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-maryland/who-we-are/history-highlights#sthash.scGkXncW.dpuf">Planned Parenthood of Maryland</a> describes the history of their organization, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1960s, PPM began providing education and training services in addition to direct health care. Clinics were opened in churches and universities; chapters were founded in other communities; education centers flourished in nearly every county in the state. Federal and state funding reached an all-time high in the 70s, only to be cut drastically in the next decade by President Ronald Reagan. PPM throughout this time maintained a strong history of growth and stability.<!-- NOTE: Citation missing --></p>

<h4 id="lgbtq-rights-movement">LGBTQ rights movement</h4>
<p>The LGBTQ rights movement in Baltimore also took shape beginning in this period and often also intersected with the local feminist movement. One nationally sigficant example of this intersection was the publication of Women: a Journal of Liberation between 1968 and 1983.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Other locally significant changes in the LGBTQ rights movement included the 1972 founding of Metropolitan Community Church (the oldest LGBT religious organization in the city), the 1974 founding of the Lesbian Community Center, and, in 1975, the first pride rally held at the Washington Monument. While the LGBTQ rights movement in Baltimore was largely white, black activists, including Louis Hughes, Jr., played a key role in organizing the Baltimore Gay Alliance in 1975 and founding the Gay Community Center of Baltimore (GCCB) in 1977. <!-- TODO: Double-check this with Louis Hughes to make sure this is an accurate description. --></p>
<h4 id="disability-rights-movement">Disability rights movement</h4>
<p>The most sigifincant accomplishements of the disability rights movement locally and nationally largely fall outside the scope of this period but should similarly be regarded as an outgrowth of the earlier history of the Civil Rights movement. According to <a href="https://archive.org/details/ERIC_ED512697">“Equality of Opportunity: The Making of the Americans with Disabilities Act”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1970, Judy Heumann, who used a wheelchair because of polio, founded Disabled in Action (DIA). […] Heumann and others felt that existing organizations were not sufficiently politically active: DIA would thus be overtly and exclusively political. It “was made up of young disabled dreamers who believed that fighting for their rights was their obligation,” said Heumann. Two more DIA organizations soon formed in Philadelphia and Baltimore. They were all cross-disability in focus and engaged such issues as transportation, architectural accessibility, television telethons, sheltered workshops, and institutionalization.<!-- FIXME: Correct citation --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maryland established the state’s Office for the Coordination of Services to the Handicapped (now known as the Department of Disabilities) in 1977 and at the national level, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_on_Disability">National Council on Disability</a> was established in 1978.</p>
<h4 id="native-and-latino-rights-movements">Native and Latino rights movements</h4>
<p>The Native rights movement, locally represented by activists in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbee">Lumbee</a> community, had a more limited intersection with other local Civil Rights movements but also developed around this same time. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_American_Indian_Center">Baltimore American Indian Center</a> was established in 1968. The Latino population of Baltimore remained small proportionally small through the 1980s and 1990s limited the impact of any local organizing efforts.<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><!-- NOTE: This Wikipedia article could actually use some work. --></p>
<h2 id="shift-to-community-development-issues">Shift to community development issues</h2>
<p>The shift of Baltimore’s Civil Rights movement to focus on community development was an evolution, not a revolution, from the work of prior decades. After all, affordable housing and public health for African Americans had emerged and remained major concerns for local activists throughout the twentieth century. However, in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, activists saw an influx of financial resources from the city and the federal government to pursue community goals. In addition, many hoped to learn from the failure of “urban renewal” programs in Harlem Park and other neighborhoods in the 1940s and 1950s and shift to an approach where community residents and community-based organizations took on more prominent leadership roles in the process.</p>
<p>Echoing later community development efforts activists pursued both an “inside” and “outside” game. The “inside” game work in historically segregated black neighborhoods to do work including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding access to culture, arts, and recreation (e.g. Operation CHAMP; Eubie Blake Cultural Center)</li>
<li>Job training and business development</li>
<li>Affordable housing development (especially in partnership with churches, e.g. St. James Terrace; N.M. Carroll Apartments)</li>
</ul>
<p>The outside game focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Housing segregation and discrimination (especially in Baltimore County or historically segrgeated white neighborhoods)</li>
<li>Hiring policies for white-owned businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>These efforts are exemplified by nonprofit groups like the Druid Heights Community Development Corporation (established 1974) and Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development (BUILD) (founded 1977).</p>

<p>Ultimately, these efforts in Baltimore contributed to a national effort to change federal policy. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Credit_Opportunity_Act">Equal Credit Opportunity Act</a> was approved in 1974 to make it against the law for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant by race, gender.

<p>By late 1969, as the Baltimore Welfare Rights Organization (BWRO) began to grow, Governor Marvin Mandel (then still serving out the remainder of Spiro Agnew’s term after Agnew became Vice-President) moved to abolish the State Board of Social Services as part of a broader plan to move state agencies from a board to a secretary system. Historian Rhonda Williams quotes Barbara Stevenson, the only welfare recipient and woman on the nine-member board, who described the abolition of the board as an “assault on the poor both black and white”, as a possible “means to stop demonstrations and protests” and as an effort to stymie “rapport built with welfare rights’ organizations and other groups.”<span class="citation" data-cites="williams_living_1998"><a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></span></p>

<p>At the time of its inception, the Baltimore Urban Services Agency inherited 23 neighborhood centers from its predecessor antipoverty agencies. These centers were distributed across the city, with higher concentrations in East and West Baltimore, where the poorest neighborhoods were (and still are) concentrated. The centers occupied repurposed churches, storefronts, libraries, public baths, or (in the case of Dunbar) associated with an existing public high school. These diverse settings served as multipurpose centers for many programs and classes for children, teens, senior citizens, young mothers, the homeless, and families in crisis. Food pantries, yoga classes, poetry readings, dance performances, legal assistance, home heating assistance, library services, and many more programmatic offerings coexisted in these spaces.<span class="citation" data-cites="faust_neighborhood_2015"><a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></span></p>

The Activists described how companies purchased houses for an average of $7,320 and sold them for an average of $12,387, a markup of 69%, with the inescapable conclusion that, “The dollar in the hands of the white man buys more than the dollar in the hands of the black man.”<span class="citation" data-cites="orser_blockbusting_1994"><a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></span></p>

<p>In 1966, the Baltimore City police finally became “fully integrated” according to the <a href="http://baltimorecitypolicehistory.com/">Baltimore Police History site</a> that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prior to 1966, African American officers were limited to foot patrols as they were barred from the use of squad cars. These officers were quarantined in rank, barred from patrolling in white neighbourhoods, and would often only be given specialty assignments in positions in the Narcotics division or as undercover plainclothes officers. […] During this time African American officers were subject to racial slurs from white co-workers during roll call, and encountered degrading racial graffiti in the very districts/units they were assigned. During this time period, two future police commissioners of Baltimore, Bishop L. Robinson and Edward J. Tilghman were amongst Baltimore’s African American police officers.</p>

<p>In July 1967, again according to <a href="http://baltimorecitypolicehistory.com/">Baltimore Police History</a>, the Baltimore City Police established the first of four “Community Relations Store Front Operations” noting, “The purpose of these centers is to reach the community on an intimate basis.

<p>Between 1968 and 1974, the Baltimore Police Department Inspectional Services Division (ISD) kept the homes of Parren Mitchell and other African-American politicians and activists under surveillance, illegally bugged home and office telephones, and placed paid informers in congressional campaigns. Beginning in 1971, Parren Mitchell began calling for the resignation of Baltimore Police Commissioner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Pomerleau">Donald Pomerleau</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>…Pomerleau sitting behind his big desk, his head cocked to one side, and he said: “I know you’ve been told we’re collecting personal information on…” and he named several prominent politicians. “Forget it,‘’ he said. ’We’re not doing that.’ ‘Wait a minute,’ I said. ‘Are you telling me you’re not collecting personal information on any politicians?’ And here is precisely what Donald Pomerleau replied: ‘Just the blacks. Just the blacks. Just the blacks.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Olesker continued his recollection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I sat there not believing my ears: Not merely because he was verifying these acts but because, in his arrogance, he would assume he could tell me about it because we shared a skin tone. It was a lie, by the way. His minions were collecting stuff on all sorts of community leaders, and skin color didn’t much matter.</p>

For example, on August 1, 1966, a group of twenty picketed at the Western District Police Station after “a Municipal Court judge declined to issue warrants charging two patrolmen with assault.”<span class="citation" data-cites="_police_1966"><a href="#fn76" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Two hundred and fifty people rallied in August 1969, to “protest the Police Department’s use of dogs and chemical sprays and to demand a civilian police.” The protest was sponsored by the Black United Front, “a coalition of militant and moderate Negro groups” led by activists including Rev. Vernon N. Dobson, president of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, and Parren J. Mitchell.<span class="citation" data-cites="lynton_250_1969"><a href="#fn77" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></span> In 1972, a small group of fifteen assembled outside the station to protest an arrest in the 1800 block of Moreland Avenue “claiming the arrest was improper and that the man was beaten by police.”<span class="citation" data-cites="_mans_1972"><a href="#fn78" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In December 1973, the Baltimore Community Relations Commission (CRC) voted to “rejoin” the Baltimore Police Department’s Complaint Evaluation Board (CEB) four years after the commission “withdrew from the board, protesting its alleged ineffecitvenss in handling complaints of police abuse from civilians.” John Wilson, chief of the commission’s Community Division, recommended against the CRC rejoining the board, remarking, “As long as the police investigate themselves… there is nothing that can be done.”<span class="citation" data-cites="_ending_1973"><a href="#fn79" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Other residents saw a need for more police protection from the violence associated with the growing trade in heroin in the late 1960s and early 1970s. One 1970 article quotes Betha Jenkins, a resident of the 300 block of E. 21st Street, reflecting on the addiction and violence found in her neighborhood, remarking, “The police don’t patrol around here nearly enough… When you need them, you have to call them.”<span class="citation" data-cites="kochakian_drug_1970"><a href="#fn80" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></span></p>
