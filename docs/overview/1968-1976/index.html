        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This period opened with the unrest following the assassination of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Baltimore and in cities across the country. At the national and the local level, the many residents and elected officials saw the 1968 unrest as a wake up call of the urgent need for more aggressive action on Civil Rights. However, others used the unrest to pursue a reactionary agenda opposed to Civil Rights.</p>
<h3 id="riots">1968 Riots</h3>
<p>By Friday:</p>
<ul>
<li>5,512 people arrested (nearly all black – about 1 in every 75 black residents)</li>
<li>12,000 troops occupied the city (1 for every 75 Baltimore residents)</li>
<li>1,208 major fires</li>
<li>1,049 businesses destroyed</li>
<li>600 injuries (50 police officers); 6 people killed<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_how_2011"><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></li>
</ul>
<p>The unrest saw 1,208 major fires and 1,049 businesses destroyed. 600 people were injured including (50 police officers). 6 people were killed.<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_how_2011"><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<p>On Tuesday, April 1968, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a> invited one hundred of Baltimore’s black leaders (a group he called “moderates” in contrast with the “circuit-riding, Hanoi-visiting type of leader”) to meet him at the State Center Office Building. Agnew used the meeting to harangue the group and charged them with “responsibility for the riots”. Most of those in attendance walked out and some drafted an “angry rebuttal” that observed, “Agnew’s actions are more in keeping with the slave system of a bygone era.” They noted that by separating “good” moderates from “bad” militants, Agnew sought to divide black activists from one another. By trying to tie moderates to militants, one minister observed: “He’s forcing us all to become militants.”<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_how_2011"><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In a reflection of the continued divisions within the Baltimore-area, however, not everyone responded with criticsm. White Baltimoreans sent hundreds of telegraphs to Agnew’s office mostly to praise him. One telegraph stated: “Thankful to hear that the white people still have a strong voice in government.”<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_how_2011"><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> Several months later at the 1968 Republican Convention, Agnew’s performance won him the nomination as Richard Nixon’s Vice-President. The selection reinforced the Nixon campaign’s “Southern strategy” to build support from the racist reaction to the Civil Rights policies of incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Democratic Party.</p>
<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>Loss of trust in public institutions and elected officials</p>
<p>Scrambled school board with multiple leadership transitions</p>
<p>After Mayor Thomas D’Alesandro opted not to run for a second term, Mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Donald_Schaefer">William Donald Schaefer</a> did not follow D’Alesandro or McKeldin’s modest activism for Civil Rights.</p>
<p>Governor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Mandel">Marvin Mandel</a> largely ambivalent on Civil Rights issues followed the example of Governor Spiro Agnew in corruption. For example, Mayor Schaefer continued to support Baltimore City Police Commisioner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Pomerleau">Donald Pommerlau</a> after a Maryland State Senate investigation in 1976 revealed that over the previous decade Pommerlau had created the Inspectional Services Division (ISD) and spied on Civil Rights activists, including Representative Parren Mitchell.</p>
<p>Election of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> in 1968; reelection in 1972 and subsequent cuts to War on Poverty programs</p>
<h3 id="population">Population</h3>
<p>The established trend of population growth in the suburbs and population loss in Baltimore City continued. Baltimore City lost a over 110,000 residents between 1970 and 1980 and African American residents went from 46.39% to 54.80% of the total. However, suburban growth also slowed.</p>
<h3 id="people">People</h3>
<p>Walter P. Carter (activist to bureaucrat?):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walter Percival Carter was a social worker and civil rights activist who led Baltimore’s chapter of the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE), organized voter registration drives and freedom rides, served as Maryland’s coordinator for the 1963 March on Washington, and was involved with protests to desegregate employment at Baltimore Gas and Electric, Gwynn Oak amusement park, and Howard Johnson hotels.<span class="citation" data-cites="faust_neighborhood_2015"><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charles Blount (bureacrat to elected officials):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A former Dunbar High School principal, Blount served as the chair of the Community Action Commission in 1968 before being elected to the Maryland State Senate in 1971. Senator Blount’s resignation from the USA board in 1985 further signaled the agency’s break with its past and the increasing distance from its predecessor programs in the War on Poverty.<span class="citation" data-cites="faust_neighborhood_2015"><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linwood Ivey (bureaucrats):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the direction of Lenwood Ivey—first named head of CAA, then MCA, then USA—Urban Services would operate a network of neighborhood service centers that remained connected to the citizens it served through geographical proximity.<span class="citation" data-cites="faust_neighborhood_2015"><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Major themes in this period include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The changing leadership and organization of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore.</li>
<li>The increasing prominence of gender and feminism within the movement and the intersection between the Civil Rights movement and social movements for disability rights, LGBTQ rights, and others.</li>
<li>The shift by many prominent Civil Rights groups from a focus on segregation and discrimination to the need to address the legacy of those factors through community development.</li>
<li>The failure of the city to address school segregation.</li>
<li>Arts and culture</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="associated-places">Associated Places</h2>
<p>Some actors within the Civil Rights movement in this period only attached to specific buildings on a temporary or fleeting basis. For example, the Baltimore Branch of the Black Panther Party organized in 1969 and shut down the organization in 1972. In that three year period, the members of the branch organized classes, community support activities, and held protest actions at dozens of different buildings and locations. <!-- NOTE: The BPP began organizing locally in 1968 --> The chapter initially operated out of a house at E. Eager Street and Homewood Avenue, offered free breakfast and lunch programs out of churches in East and West Baltimore including “St .Vincent’s D. Poore’s church in East Baltimore at Valley and Eager Street”<span class="citation" data-cites="mccutchen_black_2004"><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span> (the former St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church which closed in 1966), and, by 1970, established a “Black Community Information Center” at 1248 N. Gay Street.</p>
<p>Neighborhood Centers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time of its inception, the Baltimore Urban Services Agency inherited 23 neighborhood centers from its predecessor antipoverty agencies. These centers were distributed across the city, with higher concentrations in East and West Baltimore, where the poorest neighborhoods were (and still are) concentrated. The centers occupied repurposed churches, storefronts, libraries, public baths, or (in the case of Dunbar) associated with an existing public high school. These diverse settings served as multipurpose centers for many programs and classes for children, teens, senior citizens, young mothers, the homeless, and families in crisis. Food pantries, yoga classes, poetry readings, dance performances, legal assistance, home heating assistance, library services, and many more programmatic offerings coexisted in these spaces.<span class="citation" data-cites="faust_neighborhood_2015"><a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Community Councils:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to CAA’s neighborhood centers, Model Cities also maintained six residentially based satellite centers, known as Community Councils… These Councils were also seen as centers of black political activity, particularly in East Baltimore, and therefore eyed with concern by City Councilmen and the local media. Lenwood Ivey’s decision to eliminate these Community Councils and transfer eligible staff into the municipal Civil Service system was a controversial 1976 decision that was decidedly unpopular with residents and Council staff.<span class="citation" data-cites="faust_neighborhood_2015"><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Radical spaces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The BDC was housed in the Peace Action Center at 2525 Maryland Street on the southern and western edge of Charles Village, the neighborhood where almost all of the participants resided by that time.<span class="citation" data-cites="zanoni_working_2013"><a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="symbolic-meaning">Symbolic meaning</h3>
<p>Similar trends can be seen in the celebration of “soul food” restaurants such as The Yellow Bowl and the (restaurant in southwest Baltimore maybe on Baltimore Street).</p>
<ul>
<li>Madison Park historic district</li>
<li>Negro War Heroes Monument</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples include a 1969 picket at Roth’s Market</p>
<p>One important sites of organizing and activism are the former</p>
<p><!-- FIXME: Add the location of the market and the reason for the protest. --></p>
<h3 id="public-housing">Public housing</h3>
<p>Public and low-income housing, both existing and new, served as an important site of organizing and of conflict during the late 1960s and 1970s. Tenants’ rights groups organized among residents at Fairfield, Lafayette Courts, and Murphy Homes, among others. (see p. 176)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Low-income Housing on 1300 block of Madison Avenue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Reverend Bascom, pastor of Douglass Memorial Community Church, purchased the entire 1300 block of Madison Avenue with church funds, renovated the buildings, and converted them to low-income housing. This development reflects the transition of the Civil Rights movement towards a renewed focus on community and economic development in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example from Upton:</p>
<ul>
<li>1972: funds for the Upton project approved by federal government<span class="citation" data-cites="mcdougall_black_1993"><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span></li>
<li>1973 (McDougall says 1972): Nixon established a “moratorium on disbursements of federal money for such projects”<span class="citation" data-cites="mcdougall_black_1993"><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span> (Source: This <a href="https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/about/hud_history">history of HUD timeline</a> which also jumps from 1937 to 1965 without a single event in between!)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changing-leadership-and-organization-of-the-civil-rights-movement">Changing leadership and organization of the Civil Rights movement</h2>
<p>The people and organizations that supported Civil Rights activism in Baltimore experienced major changes in the late 1960s and 1970s. These changes reflected broader changes in the movement driven, in part, by the new access black residents and activists had to formal institutions.</p>
<p>One notable example of these changes is the 1969 election of Enolia McMillan as president of the Baltimore Branch of the NAACP. McMillan’s election won an upset victory over Juanita Jackson Mitchell, who sought the post after her mother, Lillie M. Jackson, stepped down after serving thirty four years as president of the group.<span class="citation" data-cites="brewington_enolia_2006"><a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_L._Templeton">Dr. Furman Templeton</a>, the executive director of the Baltimore Urban League since 1950, died on February 12, 1970 marking another major transition. African American Baltimoreans found new opportunities in private businesses. In 1968, Maryland National (Baltimore’s largest bank) appointed E. Thomas Williams as the bank’s first black manager.<span class="citation" data-cites="jones_black_1976"><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></span></p>
<p>These changes also affected public workers. By 1971, African American workers held 46% of the 41,000 municipal jobs in Baltimore City including some key leadership positions. For example, in July 1971, Ronald N. Patterson, previously a resident of Seattle, came to Baltimore to serve as the first black school superintendent.<span class="citation" data-cites="sartain_borders_2013"><a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p>
<!-- NOTE: That same year, a group of African American Baltimore City police officers founded their own organization the Vanguard Justice Society. What was the purpose of this organization? Who were the members? -->
<p>On January 3, 1971, Parren Mitchell took office as the first black member of the U.S. Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction. Mitchell had experience advocating for Civil Rights within and outside of government. From 1963 to 1965 he was executive secretary of the Maryland Human Relations Commission, overseeing implementation of the state’s public accommodations law. Mitchell then became director of the Baltimore Community Action Agency, an anti-poverty program, from 1965 to 1968, when he resigned and returned to Morgan State as a professor of sociology and assistant director of its Urban Affairs Institute. In 1969, he became the President of Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. where he continued through 1970. Parren Mitchell was elected as a Democrat in 1970 served seven succeeding terms in Congress from January 3, 1971 through January 3, 1987.</p>

<p>Residents and community groups:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evergreen Protective Association made a lifetime membership donation to the NAACP in the early 1960s. Their commitment to civil rights activism included providing “sandwiches, coffee and milk” along with the League of Women Voters and the Dunbar PTA, to students from Dunbar High School engaged in a sit-in at the Baltimore Department of Education in the spring of 1964. (From Edmondson Avenue National Register nomination)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>U-JOIN:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A significant aspect of this move toward addressing structural problems entailed the formation of student groups like Baltimore’s U-JOIN, headed by Lively, and CORE, which engaged in anti-poverty activism, understanding it as central to anti-racist struggles, in the early 1960s. U-JOIN was founded by members of Baltimore SDS as part of its Emergency Rehabilitation Assistance Project (ERAP) and included students from Hopkins, Goucher, and Morgan, as well as non-students and people that dropped out of school to fight for social justice. ERAP, according to Rhonda Williams, was “hoping to build an ‘interracial movement’ by galvanizing poor people at the grass roots around issues such as housing, schools, medical care, and food insecurity.”<span class="citation" data-cites="zanoni_working_2013"><a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p>

<h3 id="black-power">Black Power</h3>
<p>Paul Coates on the Black Panther Party in Baltimore (early 1969 to late 1972):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought that the party was doing things that would have an impact on the lives of black people. It seemed like a good vehicle. When I came in, I had only a limited basis for understanding the world. I just knew it was fucked up. But I had no perspective, no point of view. No process for sorting out the significance of the things I was seeing and experiencing, no process for validating my views against those of other people. In the party I began to develop my own system of political understanding. The party had a structure in place to encourage political education. He provided a setting where I could interact with people who are searching for answers, and with some who thought they knew the answers.<span class="citation" data-cites="mcdougall_black_1993"><a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>White allies of the Black Panther Party; Baltimore Committee for Political Freedom “formed because of fear that the local police were planning to assassinate Black Panther Party leaders in the city”; membership included<span class="citation" data-cites="mcdougall_black_1993"><a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Peter Rossi, Social Relations Department of Johns Hopkins University</li>
<li>William Zinman, attorney for the Maryland ACLU</li>
<li>Rev. Chester Wickwire, white minister</li>
</ul>
<p>New organizations emerged such as the Soul School and Mother Rescuers. The Black Panthers, established in Oakland in October 1966, had established a Baltimore Chapter by 1968 but suffered from internal divisions and surveillance and harassment from the from federal and local police. This is exemplified by the arrest of Marshall “Eddie” Conway on April 23, 1970.<span class="citation" data-cites="conway_marshall_2011"><a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 id="feminism">Feminism</h3>
<p>The growth of the feminist movement at a national level brought new opportunities for African American women in Baltimore during this period and focused attention on sexism within the Civil Rights movement and racism within the feminist movement.</p>
<p>The late 1960s and early 1970s saw major changes for national policies affecting women. On October 13, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11375">Executive Order 11375</a> forbidding sex discrimination in businesses working with the government. In 1972, Congress passed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX">Title IX</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Amendments_of_1972">1972 Educational Amendments</a> to the Civil Rights Act to enforce sex equality in education (forcing educational institutions to support women’s sports). On January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down many state abortion laws with the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roev.Wade">Roe v. Wade</a></em> decision.</p>
<p>Activists also organized at the national level as in 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) organized in Washington, DC and, in 1973, the National Black Feminist Organization formed in New York.</p>

>In the 1960s, PPM began providing education and training services in addition to direct health care. Clinics were opened in churches and universities; chapters were founded in other communities; education centers flourished in nearly every county in the state. Federal and state funding reached an all-time high in the 70s, only to be cut drastically in the next decade by President Ronald Reagan. PPM throughout this time maintained a strong history of growth and stability.

<h2 id="shift-to-community-development-issues">Shift to community development issues</h2>
<p>The shift of Baltimore’s Civil Rights movement to focus on community development was an evolution, not a revolution, from the work of prior decades. After all, affordable housing and public health for African Americans had emerged and remained major concerns for local activists throughout the twentieth century. However, in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, activists now had new resources from the city and the federal government to pursue community goals. In addition, many hoped to learn from the failure of “urban renewal” programs in Harlem Park and other neighborhoods in the 1940s and 1950s and shift to an approach where community residents and community-based organizations took on more prominent leadership roles in the process.</p>
<p>Echoing later community development efforts activists pursued both an “inside” and “outside” game. The “inside” game work in historically segregated black neighborhoods to do work including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding access to culture, arts, and recreation (e.g. Operation CHAMP; Eubie Blake Cultural Center)</li>
<li>Job training and business development</li>
<li>Affordable housing development (especially in partnership with churches, e.g. St. James Terrace; N.M. Carroll Apartments)</li>
</ul>
<p>The outside game focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Housing segregation and discrimination (especially in Baltimore County or historically segrgeated white neighborhoods)</li>
<li>Hiring policies for white-owned businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>These efforts are exemplified by nonprofit groups like the Druid Heights Community Development Corporation (established 1974) and Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development (BUILD) (founded 1977); and by new city and state agencies such as the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture (MCAAHC) (established 1969).</p>

<p>Ultimately, these efforts in Baltimore contributed to a national effort to change federal policy. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Credit_Opportunity_Act">Equal Credit Opportunity Act</a> was approved in 1974 to make it against the law for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant by race, gender. In 1977, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Reinvestment_Act">Community Reinvestment Act</a> passed.</p>
<h3 id="anti-poverty-efforts">Anti-poverty efforts</h3>
<p>By late 1969, as the Baltimore Welfare Rights Organization (BWRO) began to grow, Governor Marvin Mandel (then still serving out the remainder of Spiro Agnew’s term after Agnew became Vice-President) moved to abolish the State Board of Social Services as part of a broader plan to move state agencies from a board to a secretary system. Historian Rhonda Williams quotes Barbara Stevenson, the only welfare recipient and woman on the nine-member board, who described the abolition of the board as an “assault on the poor both black and white”, as a possible “means to stop demonstrations and protests” and as an effort to stymie “rapport built with welfare rights’ organizations and other groups.”<span class="citation" data-cites="williams_living_1998"><a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Historian Rhonda Williams describes a campaign from 1966 to 1978 that put the welfare department, housing authority, and city officials “on notice” by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>calling attention to its commitment to business and revitalization while ignoring or heaping the burden on the backs of poor people.“<span class="citation" data-cites="williams_living_1998"><a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Historian Rhonda Williams quotes the “battle cry” issued in 1969 by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Welfare_Rights_Organization">National Welfare Rights Organization</a> (NWRO) and adopted by local activists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are not willing to sell our rights as American citizens, our rights to dignity, our rights to justice, our rights to democracy, for the food, clothing and shelter which our age, our disability, the absence or death of our family’s breadwinner, our lack of economic opportunity, our society, have made us unable to provide.<span class="citation" data-cites="williams_living_1998"><a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span></p>

<h2 id="housing-segregation-and-discrimination">Housing segregation and discrimination</h2>
<p>In 1969, a coalition of black and white civil rights advocates, including chairman Sampson Green, an African-American attorney, member of the Maryland Human Relations Commission, and housing committee chairman, and John J. Martinez, white Jesuit teacher at St. Bernadine’s, organized The Activists—an interracial fair housing organization. The group targeted the Morris Goldseker Company with protests outside its downtown offices highlighting its role as “block-busters.” Operating under a variety of names, the Goldseker-related realty companies doubled the mark-up on house sales in Edmondson Village in comparison to other areas. The Activists described how companies purchased houses for an average of $7,320 and sold them for an average of $12,387, a markup of 69%, with the inescapable conclusion that, “The dollar in the hands of the white man buys more than the dollar in the hands of the black man.”<span class="citation" data-cites="orser_blockbusting_1994"><a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></span></p>
