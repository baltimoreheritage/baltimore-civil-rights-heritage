        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>On July 11, 1966, members of the Civic Interest Group (CIG) held a press conference at St. Peter Claver’s Catholic Church on Pennsylvania Avenue. The group publicly endorsed black power and announced that members “would no longer avoid violence in cases of ‘self-defense’.”<!-- Citation missing --> The announcement was part of a changing national movement evidenced by the founding of the Black Panther Party in Oakland, California less than three months later. In Baltimore, many white student activists who had joined the Civic Interest Group in past protests began to shift their focus towards peace activism against the Vietnam War by the mid-1960s. Black activist efforts to reshape a Civil Rights movement that some local residents saw as dominated by a small group of middle-class leaders. However, the politics of white reaction to even limited Civil Rights gains undermined the ability of activists to deliver enduring changes in the conditions of racial and economic inequality for Black Baltimoreans. <!-- What does this all mean? --></p>
<!-- In 1966, Mayor McKeldin's Task Force for Equal Rights began developing a plan for further action on school desegregation. His successor, Mayor [Thomas D'Alesandro III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_D%27Alesandro_III), named Baltimore "Education City, USA" to highlight his commitment to supporting integrated and desirable schools. -->
<p>While decades of activism from the 1930s through the 1960s had succeeded in overturning many of the city, state, and federal policies that required racial segregation and protected racial discrimination, the legacy of these policies continued to shape the lives of black Baltimoreans and the conditions of historically segregated black neighborhoods. The racist reaction by white Marylanders—exemplified by the thousands of people voting for George P. Mahoney in that year’s gubernatorial election—stifled efforts to mitigate the deep racial inequality in Baltimore and across the country.</p>
<p>The conflicts and concerns that drove the Civil Rights movement are most notably in the legacy of local reactions to the 1968 unrest following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> in Memphis, Tennessee on April 4. The following day, unrest broke out in Detroit and Washington, D.C. Three hundred people gathered in Baltimore for a peaceful memorial service on the morning of Saturday, April 6. Then, in the afternoon, residents began to attack properties in East Baltimore and fires broke out at multiple locations. The unrest spread quickly and continued through Thursday, April 11.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, April 9, 1968, Maryland Governor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a> invited one hundred of Baltimore’s black leaders to meet at the State Center Office Building built in 1958 near the Fifth Regiment Armory as part of an urban renewal project a decade earlier. Agnew used the meeting to deliver a one-sided lecture and charged the participants with responsibility for the unrest.<span class="citation" data-cites="GovernorAgnewSpeech1968 OfferAnalysisEvaluationSpeech1968"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> Most of the activists in attendance walked out. Some drafted an “angry rebuttal” observing, “Agnew’s actions are more in keeping with the slave system of a bygone era.” They noted that by separating “good” moderates from “bad” militants (what Agnew pejoratively labeled the “circuit-riding, Hanoi-visiting type of leader”), the governor sought to divide black activists from one another. One minister observed: “He’s forcing us all to become militants.”<span class="citation" data-cites="BaumBrownBaltimore2011"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In a vivid example of the political divisions among local residents, however, hundreds of white Baltimoreans sent telegraphs to Agnew’s office—most praising his attack on Baltimore’s black leaders. One stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Thankful to hear that the white people still have a strong voice in government.”<span class="citation" data-cites="BaumBrownBaltimore2011"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the end of the week, it was clear to everyone that the unrest had left thousands of residents reeling from the damage to their neighborhoods. Police arrested 5,512 people (nearly all of them black; totaling about one in every seventy-five black residents). At the height of the response, 12,000 troops occupied the city (one for every seventy-five city residents). Six hundred people were injured (fifty police officers among them). The city saw 1,208 major fires and 1,049 businesses damaged. Six people were killed—all African American.<span class="citation" data-cites="BaumBrownBaltimore2011"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span><!-- TODO: Double-check that the six people killed in the 1968 unrest are all African American. --></p>

<p>Historian Rhonda Williams observed that the 1968 uprisings: “revealed poor people’s frustration and fear and their desires to attack exploitation and obtain consumer goods.” Williams notes activist Walter Lively’s warning in a February 1968 speech, explaining how “white decision makers” must “give colored citizens a stake in what America is before ghetto dwellers could see a chance to accomplish their goals without violence.”<span class="citation" data-cites="WilliamsPoliticsPublicHousing2004"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> While some local white residents and elected officials saw the unrest as an urgent wake up call demanding new aggressive action on issues related to the civil rights of Black Baltimoreans. Others, however, used the unrest as the pretext to pursue a reactionary agenda opposing expanded opportunities for black Baltimoreans.<!-- Citation needed. --></p>
<p>From the late 1960s through the late 1970s, the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore was shaped by both a renewed progressive vision for reinvestment in historically segregated black neighborhoods and a reactionary withdrawal continuing the pattern of “white flight” that followed World War II. The celebrated “peaceful” desegregation of Baltimore’s public schools proved completely inadequate to sustain integration. Housing policies in both the city and surrounding suburbs promoted increasing residential segregation in the 1960s and 1970s. At the same time, Baltimore’s total population dropped precipitously. Between 1970 and 1980, Baltimore City lost over 110,000 residents and African American residents became a majority of the city’s population for the first time.<!-- Citation needed. --> Thousands of white Baltimoreans had moved out to the surrounding suburbs—an option that was largely unavailable for African Americans even after the Fair Housing Act in 1968.</p>
<p>As early as 1970, a pattern of racially segregated development in Baltimore County led to hearings by the Maryland Civil Rights Commission at the Social Security Administration headquarters in Woodlawn. The hearings documented how county officials had opposed open housing, discouraged affordable housing development, and displaced existing black communities.<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010 MarylandStateAdvisoryCommitteetotheU.S.CommissiononCivilRightsZoningPlanningProcess1971"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> Unfortunately, the growing awareness of the issue did little to reverse the trends with local elected officials who avoided making any substantial reforms to policies around zoning, public housing, or school desegregation.</p>
<p>Continuing a pattern established in the early twentieth century, local government implemented racially discriminatory land use policies included not just exclusion but also displacement and clearance. In the African American community of East Towson, for example, numerous homes and public buildings (such as the East Towson Child Development Center at 102 E. Pennsylvania Avenue) were demolished around this time<!--What years?--> but several others survived, including the St. James African United Methodist Protestant Church (built 1881, enlarged in 1906, and renovated in 1968) at 415 Jefferson Avenue the Carver High School/East Towson Carver Community Center (built in 1939) at 300 Lennox Avenue.<span class="citation" data-cites="EHTTraceriesCarverHighSchool2001"><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> Within the city, hundreds of working-class and poor African American residents were displaced by urban renewal, public housing, and transportation projects. For example, between 1973 and 1977, nine hundred and seventy-one rowhouses and sixty-two businesses came down in West Baltimore to make way for the partial construction of the East-West Expressway.<span class="citation" data-cites="Dilts3Aroaddeadline1973"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span> Hundreds of more houses at the edges of downtown fell for the construction of Martin Luther King Boulevard beginning in 1976.<span class="citation" data-cites="DiltsResidentsfacefact1975"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Local businesses and community organizations were also transformed by these efforts. In 1971, the city tore down the much-beloved Royal Theatre at 1329 Pennsylvania Avenue. One 1986 account, recalled the Royal as “the brightest gem along the cultural and business strip that made Pennsylvania Avenue the nucleus of Baltimore’s black community from the 1920s through the 1960s”. The author attributed the theater’s decline to both the integration of other theaters in Baltimore in the 1960s and the competition from the opening of the Civic Centre (now the Baltimore Arena) in 1962.<span class="citation" data-cites="GiulianoRoyalTheatreReview1986"><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span> The Arch Social Club was forced to sell the clubhouse on Saratoga Street they had occupied since 1922<!-- Double-check the date. --> and move to the former Schanze Theatre on Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
<!-- Comment from Josh Davis: Also the passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968. And the general push factor of Black suburbanization (and just Black movement out of the urban course), which was smaller than White suburbanization but starting to happen nationally and probably in Baltimore, too. Wiese's Places of Their Own may be helpful, not sure. -->
<!-- NOTE: What happened to poverty and employment in this period? How does the city deal with job loss and revenue loss? -->
<p>The following sections explore how the changing Civil Rights movement and the changing urban landscape developed in the late 1960s and 1970s along five themes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Politics and organizing</strong>: The changing leadership and organization of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore. How was the movement shaped by Black Power? How did the movement intersect with social movements for feminism, LGBTQ rights, disability rights, and others?</li>
<li><strong>Housing and community development</strong>: The shift by Civil Rights activists to focus on community and economic development (especially housing). How did approaches to community development address the legacies of segregation and discrimination? How did people reinvest in historically segregated neighborhoods? How did people address the withdrawal of white residents and white-controlled businesses and institutions from those same neighborhoods?</li>
<li><strong>Education</strong>: The failure to end persistent racial segregation in Baltimore’s public schools. What did government and community groups do to address segregation? Why did their efforts largely fail?</li>
<li><strong>Criminal injustice</strong>: The impact of police surveillance and the role of police violence in shaping Civil Rights activism during this period.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural expression</strong>: The intersection of the Civil Rights movement with visual and performing arts and cultural heritage institutions. How are African Americans and African American culture and history represented? How does it appear in public art, monuments, and the preservation of historic places associated with African Americans in Baltimore?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="politics-and-organizing">Politics and organizing</h2>
<!-- NOTE: How were black and white Baltimore residents affected by the Civil Rights movement and related issues? How about in the suburbs? -->
<p>The huge legislative and judicial accomplishments of the movement between 1954 and 1968 resulted in dramatic changes in Baltimore and Maryland’s political landscape. The structure of the movement and the goals of local activists shifted to adjust to new demands for economic justice and the frustrating work of trying to enforce the new protections Black Baltimoreans had won. The broader national movement also helped to inspire or encourage range of related social movements. While local and national movements for feminism, LGBTQ rights, disability rights, senior rights, and Native rights, had, of course, been building for decades, a consideration of these efforts offer an opportunity to look at the experiences of Black women, Black men and women who identified as gay or lesbian, and Black people with disabilities.</p>

<!-- Hundreds of white residents attended segregationist rallies organized by the [National States' Rights Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_States%27_Rights_Party) in Patterson Park or Riverside Park in 1966.

In 1966, candidate [George P. Mahoney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P._Mahoney) won an upset victory in the Democratic primary for Governor (receiving around 30% of the vote). In the general election, Mahoney based his campaign on his opposition to open housing with the slogan "Your home is your castle; protect it."[@HardestyVeilVoodooGeorge2009; @HardestyveilvoodooGeorge2008] The controversy surrounding Mahoney's racist campaign led a third independent candidate to enter the race which ended with the election of Spiro Agnew.

<p>One notable example of the changes for the leadership of Civil Rights activist organizations during this time is the 1969 election of Enolia McMillan (1904-2006) as president of the Baltimore Branch of the NAACP. On December 16, 1969, McMillan won an upset victory at Sharp Street Church (winning with 101 to 77 votes) over Juanita Jackson Mitchell, who had sought the post after her mother, Lillie M. Jackson, stepped down after serving thirty-four years as president of the group. When she became president, McMillan hoped to reach out to young “black militants” who felt disconnected from the NAACP remarking, “I’ve been a militant all of my life but I am not extreme.”<span class="citation" data-cites="BrewingtonEnoliaMcMillan2006"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span> McMillan’s efforts to expand membership were largely successful and, by 1972, the chapter had 5,205 members and 828 youth members, about 1,000 more than the year before.<span class="citation" data-cites="SartainBordersEqualityNAACP2013"><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>

<p>Other prominent activists and organizers in this period included Walter Percival Carter (1923-1971).<span class="citation" data-cites="RitesSetWalter1971"><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></span> Aiden Faust describes Carter’s significant legacy writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walter Percival Carter was a social worker and civil rights activist who led Baltimore’s chapter of the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE), organized voter registration drives and freedom rides, served as Maryland’s coordinator for the 1963 March on Washington, and was involved with protests to desegregate employment at Baltimore Gas and Electric, Gwynn Oak amusement park, and Howard Johnson hotels.<span class="citation" data-cites="FaustNeighborhoodMattersWhat2015"><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p>

<p>African American Baltimoreans also found new opportunities in private businesses. In 1968, Maryland National (Baltimore’s largest bank) appointed E. Thomas Williams as the bank’s first black manager.<span class="citation" data-cites="JonesBlackEliteBaltimore1976"><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></span> However, as the example of Walter P. Carter illustrates, many black Baltimoreans (including activists) found more new opportunities in local and state government. By 1971, African American workers held 46% of the 41,000 municipal jobs in Baltimore City including some key leadership positions.<span class="citation" data-cites="SartainBordersEqualityNAACP2013"><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Black workers employed by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation organized several protests at the company’s main office in Sparrow’s Point in October 1969 to demand changes to the working conditions in the blast-furnace department. Ivory Dennis, the head of the civil rights committee for the Local 2610 of the United Steelworkers (AFL-CIO) explained that “workers were protesting a lack of a sufficient number of Negro supervisors, an inadequate incentive pay and the absence of lunch breaks for some of the workers.”<span class="citation" data-cites="NegroSteelworkersStage1969"><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></span></p>
<!-- NOTE: That same year, a group of African American Baltimore City police officers founded their own organization the Vanguard Justice Society. What was the purpose of this organization? Who were the members? In 1984, Mayor Schaefer appointed the first black police commissioner. -->
<p>Others went from working for the city to running the city as elected officials. Charles Blount, a former principal at Dunbar High School, served on the Community Action Commission in 1968 and won election to the Maryland State Senate in 1971. Later, in 1985, Blount resigned from the board of the Urban Services Agency to protest the regressive cuts and policy changes affecting the organization.<span class="citation" data-cites="FaustNeighborhoodMattersWhat2015"><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Across the country, between 1964 and 1975, the number of African American elected officials grew from 100 to almost 3,000 (135 of them mayors) but the first black mayor in Baltimore was not elected until Kurt Schmoke in 1987.<span class="citation" data-cites="WilliamsPoliticsPublicHousing2004"><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></span></p>
<p>On January 3, 1971, Parren Mitchell took office as the first black member of the U.S. Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction. Mitchell had experience advocating for Civil Rights within and outside of government. From 1963 to 1965, he was executive secretary of the Maryland Human Relations Commission, overseeing implementation of the state’s public accommodations law. Mitchell then became director of the Baltimore Community Action Agency, an anti-poverty program, from 1965 to 1968, when he resigned and returned to Morgan State University as a professor of sociology and assistant director of its Urban Affairs Institute. In 1969, he became the President of Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. where he continued through 1970. Parren Mitchell was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1970 served seven succeeding terms from January 3, 1971 through January 3, 1987.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Inevitably, this period was marked by the passing of an earlier generation of local Civil Rights leaders, many of whom remained active in local politics up until their death. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_L._Templeton">Dr. Furman Templeton</a>, the executive director of the Baltimore Urban League since 1950, died on February 12, 1970.<span class="citation" data-cites="DrFurmanTempleton1970 DrTempletonRights1970"><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span> Physician and long-time activist Dr. John T.

<p>White activists and allies also played a significant role in this period. Walter Sondheim, for example, was hailed as a “civic leader” for his management of the desegregation of Baltimore’s public schools and downtown urban renewal efforts.<span class="citation" data-cites="DorseyProlificModestWalter1975"><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></span> White allies played a particularly important role in efforts around housing segregation and neighborhood stabilization through organizations like Baltimore Neighbors, Inc.</p>
<p>The importance of interracial activism was illustrated in the changing membership of Baltimore’s City Council. A contested redistricting process in early 1971 led to more opportunities for black candidates to win election to the Council.<span class="citation" data-cites="Price3rdBardPlanHas1971 Price3rdNEGROVOTEHELD1971 Price3rdDISTRICTINGPLANSIGNED1971"><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></span> By October, anticipating the near certain outcome of the election based on the results of the Democratic primary, the <em>Sun</em> wrote:</p>

<h3 id="changes-for-activist-organizations">Changes for activist organizations</h3>
<p>In many of the neighborhoods where African American households were buying homes they could never have purchased a decade earlier, black middle-income residents<!-- NOTE: What proportion of this new cohort of residents were middle v. low-income? Who participated in resident organizing in the 1950s? --> organized a new set of community groups that played an important role in local debates over school segregation, housing, and community development policy. One example is the Evergreen Protective Association which represented residents in the Evergreen neighborhood located within the Edmondson Avenue National Register Historic District. The association made a lifetime membership donation to the NAACP in the early 1960s and provided “sandwiches, coffee and milk” (along with the League of Women Voters and the Dunbar PTA) to students from Dunbar High School engaged in a sit-in at the Baltimore Department of Education in the spring of 1964.<!-- NOTE: Citation missing! --><!-- QUESTION: What was the purpose of the 1964 sit-in? --></p>
<p>The Baltimore City Fair provided another way these new organizations connected around shared interests and concerns. In 1970, Hope Quackenbush, the first executive director of the Baltimore City Fair, remarked that the event was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>intended to showcase to the entire Baltimore population the true strengths of a city determined to solve its problems, to help neighborhoods help themselves and to capture the flavor of a fascinating and exciting city […] In place of the traditional exposition of agriculture one finds at a county fair, our fair will display the product of the city, its people and its culture. Each participating neighborhood will have on display the elements that make it unique and special […] The participating neighborhoods will come from every corner of Baltimore—restoration communities, black communities, ethnic communities, garden communities, golden age communities—all presenting one message, We are Baltimore.<span class="citation" data-cites="ShokenBringbackBaltimore2000"><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this same time, Baltimore saw the expansion of anti-poverty and Black Power organizations with a different agenda than older Civil Rights organizations (seen by many as focused exclusively on middle-class concerns). At the national level, these changes are illustrated by the founding of the Black Panthers in Oakland in October 1966 and the rise of the Nation of Islam in the 1950s and 1960s. The Black Panthers struggled in Baltimore in large part due to a campaign of harassment and surveillance by the FBI and the Baltimore City Police Department.<span class="citation" data-cites="HolterVanguardNeverCaught2017 ConwayMarshallLawLife2011"><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></span> Paul Coates, a member of the Black Panther Party in Baltimore described the role of the organization between early 1969 and late 1972:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought that the party was doing things that would have an impact on the lives of black people. It seemed like a good vehicle. When I came in, I had only a limited basis for understanding the world. … I just knew it was fucked up. But I had no perspective, no point of view. No process for sorting out the significance of the things I was seeing and experiencing, no process for validating my views against those of other people. In the Party, I began to develop my own system of political understanding. The Party had a structure in place to encourage political education. It provided a setting where I could interact with people who are searching for answers, and with some who thought they knew the answers.<span class="citation" data-cites="McdougallBlackBaltimoreNew1993"><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Baltimore Branch of the Black Panther Party used a number of different buildings between the earliest organization of the chapter in 1968 and group’s end in 1972. Over those four years, the group organized classes, community support activities, and protests at dozens of different buildings. The group initially grew out of the Soul School located at 522 North Fremont Avenue near the George P. Murphy Homes. The first formal chapter headquarters was a house at 1209 North Eden Street and the members began organizing free breakfast and lunch programs at St. Martin de Porres Recreation Hall (located in the former St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church; a building occupied in 2017 by Sweet Prospect Baptist Church). By 1970, the headquarters (also referenced as a “Black Community Information Center”) had moved to a rented house at 1248 N. Gay Street.<span class="citation" data-cites="HolterVanguardNeverCaught2017 McCutchenBlackPantherParty2004"><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The emergence of Black Power movement changed how white allies approached their efforts to support the Civil Rights movement locally and nationally. For example, the largely white Baltimore Committee for Political Freedom “formed because of fear that the local police were planning to assassinate Black Panther Party leaders in the city”. The Committee’s members included Dr. Peter Rossi, Social Relations Department of Johns Hopkins University, William Zinman, an attorney for the Maryland ACLU, and Rev. Chester Wickwire (1913-2008), a white minister.<span class="citation" data-cites="McdougallBlackBaltimoreNew1993"><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Another example of a center for white people who supported the Civil Rights movement is the Peace Action Center at 2525 Maryland Avenue described by Amy E. Zanoni as the “locus for the city’s antiwar movement”. The Center provided office and meeting space, a mimeograph machine, and a paid full-time staff person, Gren Whitman, for the Baltimore Defense Committee and <em>Peace and Freedom News</em>, “Baltimore’s first underground newspaper”. Whitman’s salary was funded by a “progressive peace tax paid by the BDC’s members.”<span class="citation" data-cites="ZanoniWorkingmanylevels2013"><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></span> Other examples are found through the Catholic workers movement including Viva House located at 26 S. Mount Street in southwest Baltimore since 1970.</p>
<p>However, the Black Power movement, arguably, exacerbated internal divisions within the Civil Rights movement, especially around issues of class. In one illustrative example, in November 1968, attorney and activist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florynce_Kennedy">Florynce Kennedy</a> delivered a keynote address for Woman Power’s 11th annual Leadership Conference at the Belvedere Hotel in Mount Vernon that discouraged voting for mainstream political party candidates and warned “middle-class Negroes” to “watch your tail while trying to climb on the big white ship.” According to an account by Lula Jones Garrett in the AFRO, “Her audience sat shocked, with stiff shoulders, pursed lips and raised eyebrows as they listened.”<span class="citation" data-cites="WomanPowerAnnual1968"><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Other local examples include tenants and welfare rights organizations such as Mother Rescuers (whose development is chronicled in detail by historian Rhonda Williams) and the Soul School.<span class="citation" data-cites="WilliamsPoliticsPublicHousing2004 WilliamsPursuitAudaciousPower2010"><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></span> Historian Amy Zanoni describes the change for local activists, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A significant aspect of this move toward addressing structural problems entailed the formation of student groups like Baltimore’s U-JOIN, headed by Lively, and CORE, which engaged in anti-poverty activism, understanding it as central to anti-racist struggles, in the early 1960s. U-JOIN was founded by members of Baltimore SDS as part of its Emergency Rehabilitation Assistance Project (ERAP) and included students from Hopkins, Goucher, and Morgan, as well as non-students and people that dropped out of school to fight for social justice. ERAP, according to Rhonda Williams, was “hoping to build an ‘interracial movement’ by galvanizing poor people at the grass roots around issues such as housing, schools, medical care, and food insecurity.”<span class="citation" data-cites="ZanoniWorkingmanylevels2013"><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></span></p>

<p>Both nationally and locally, the Civil Rights movement provided a powerful example for movements to protect and expand the rights of women, sexual minorities, people with disabilities, Native Americans, and others. Historian Anne Valk has argued that historians of postwar social movements must pay close attention to the “cross-fertilization of ideas” that took place between various movements.<span class="citation" data-cites="ValkRadicalSistersSecondwave2008"><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></span> Similarly in Baltimore, later activist movements often borrowed strategies and tactics from the Civil Rights movement and, in some cases, included overlapping individual participants.</p>
<h4 id="feminist-movement">Feminist movement</h4>
<p>The growth of the feminist movement at a national level brought new opportunities for African American women in Baltimore during this period and focused attention on sexism within the Civil Rights movement and racism within the feminist movement. The necessity of addressing both racial and gender discrimination was clear to Councilwoman Victorine Q. Adams in her 1971 remarks to a class of students at Morgan State University. Adams cited a “white political power structure [that] did not listen to black people” and “black politicians who paid their women no mind” as her inspiration for organizing the Colored Women’s Democratic Club in 1946 and Woman Power, Inc. in 1957.<span class="citation" data-cites="PeoplePlacesThings1971"><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></span><!-- TODO: Double-check the date for Woman Power, Inc. --></p>
<p>The late 1960s and early 1970s saw major changes in national policies affecting women. On October 13, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11375">Executive Order 11375</a> forbidding sex discrimination in businesses working with the government.

The new policy enforced “sex equality” in education and forced educational institutions to support women’s sports. On January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down many state abortion laws with the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roev.Wade">Roe v. Wade</a></em> decision.</p>
<p>White and black women also organized at the national level. Notably, in 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) organized in Washington, DC and, in 1973, the National Black Feminist Organization formed in New York.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> At the local level, some of the urgent issues that galvanized the movement were access to contraception, family planning services, and health services for women.

<p>In 1970, Judy Heumann, who used a wheelchair because of polio, founded Disabled in Action (DIA). […] Heumann and others felt that existing organizations were not sufficiently politically active: DIA would thus be overtly and exclusively political. It “was made up of young disabled dreamers who believed that fighting for their rights was their obligation,” said Heumann. Two more DIA organizations soon formed in Philadelphia and Baltimore.

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>A decade after the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, residents and school officials could not help but see that the policy of “school choice” had done very little to end racially segregated education in Baltimore. In May 1968, the Supreme Court ruling in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_v._County_School_Board_of_New_Kent_County">Green v. New Kent County</a></em> found that to meet the standard set over a decade before a free choice policy needed to actually integrate schools. In response, Baltimore City Solicitor George Russell submitted a nine-page opinion noting that 34% of black students in Baltimore attended all-black schools and “deprived of their constitutional right of attending integrated schools.”<span class="citation" data-cites="BaumBrownBaltimore2011"><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></span> Baltimore’s school choice policy was clearly unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The following year, William Donald Schaefer’s new administration proved even more reticent to response to the Supreme Court decision, avoiding talking about school desegregation because “immediately the question of race comes in.”<span class="citation" data-cites="BaumBrownBaltimore2011"><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></span><!-- NOTE: What is Baum's source for this quote? --> The Supreme Court again pushed the reluctant administration towards action when the 1971 decision in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swann_v.Charlotte-Mecklenburg_Board_of_Education">Swann v.

When Baltimore City finally began to develop a proposal for busing under the administration of Superintendent Dr. Roland N. Patterson, white residents and elected officials pushed back. In southeast Baltimore, white residents opposed to desegregation organized the Southeast Desegregation Coalition. The coalition had support from then City Council member, later Senator, Barbara Mikulski who wrote a letter to the editor of the East Baltimore Guide stating: “I am totally opposed to forced cross-town busing.”<span class="citation" data-cites="BaumBrownBaltimore2011"><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></span> In 1975, the Federal Office of Civil Rights begins enforcement hearings against Maryland but, ultimately, Baltimore’s schools remained segregated.</p>

<p>The changing focus is illustrated in June 1968, when Rev. Walter L. Hildebrand, the new pastor at Bethel AME Church, affirmed the church’s plans to make the church “of utmost service to the poor, the hopeless and the oppressed.”<span class="citation" data-cites="OliverNewpastorhopes1968"><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 id="housing">Housing</h3>
<p>Efforts to protest continued housing segregation and discrimination took a variety of forms during this period. One of the most notable efforts began in 1969, when a coalition of black and white civil rights advocates (including chairman Sampson Green, an African American attorney, member of the Maryland Human Relations Commission, and housing committee chairman, and John J. Martinez, white Jesuit teacher at St. Bernadine’s) organized The Activists. The fair housing advocacy organization targeted the Morris Goldseker Company by holding protests outside its downtown offices highlighting the company’s role as a “block-buster” taking advantage of both white sellers and black buyers. Operating under a variety of names, the Goldseker-related realty companies doubled the mark-up on house sales in Edmondson Village in comparison to other areas during the 1960s. The Activists described how companies purchased houses for an average of $7,320 and sold them for an average of $12,387, a markup of 69%, leading them to an inescapable conclusion: “The dollar in the hands of the white man buys more than the dollar in the hands of the black man.”<span class="citation" data-cites="OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994"><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Black Baltimoreans also continued to contend with inequities in access to both public and private investment. In the spring of 1975, a new federal study found that lenders denied home loans to African American borrowers in Baltimore at twice the rate of white borrowers.<span class="citation" data-cites="SchwerzlerReactiondividedstudy1975"><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></span> One of the state’s largest lenders, Maryland National Bank, reportedly “rejected black applicants for home mortgages” at nearly twelve times the rate for white applicants in 1974.<span class="citation" data-cites="EdsallBlacksfindmortgages1975"><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In his popular history of racial segregation in Baltimore, writer Antero Pietila highlighted the major role of Baltimore County politician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Anderson_(politician)">Dale Anderson</a> in promoting segregated residential development during his term as County Executive from 1966 to 1974. Earlier efforts, beginning with the County’s first zoning law in 1949, confined rowhouse and apartment development to eastern Baltimore County in the area of Dundalk and Essex-Middle River.<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010"><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></span> During his term as County Executive from 1962 to 1966, Spiro Agnew “ousted” the chairman of the Baltimore County Community Relations Commission after he “endorsed open housing” saying the chairman “confused civil equality with social acceptance”. Agnew continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open occupancy legislation, the attempted crashing of private membership clubs, unlawful trespassing and unlawful demonstrating, violate the civil rights of others just as clearly as segregation violates the civil rights of the Negro. I take a strong position that it is wrong to tell the owner of a private dwelling place, be it single family or multiple unit, that he must offer it for rent or sale to anyone with whom he does not wish to do business. This applies whether or not he is biased and applies regardless of what his bias may embrace. If he dislikes Greeks he should not have to deal with Greeks, and the government that infringes upon his discretion in this respect abrogates his freedom of selection, and disregards the intent of the Constitution of the United States.<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010"><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The political power of white opposition to open housing can clearly be seen in George P. Mahoney’s 1966 campaign for governor and notorious slogan: “Your Home is Your Castle – Protect It.”<span class="citation" data-cites="HardestyveilvoodooGeorge2008 HardestyVeilVoodooGeorge2009"><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Agnew’s successor, Dale Anderson sought to absolve the county from responsibility for segregation in 1969 remarking, “There are no walls around Baltimore County.”<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010"><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></span> In contrast, most observers saw a deliberate effort to promote racial segregation through opposition to open housing and policies that displaced existing black communities. In 1972, the Social Security Administration announced an expansion plan that anticipated 2,800 workers (mostly African American) moving to the Woodlawn area. Anderson opposed the plan, commenting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not one house in that bracket will pay enough taxes to educate one child, and how many of those people coming in here are going to have one child or more?<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010"><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That same year, Anderson eliminated four key positions in the Baltimore County Planning Department (in the midst of what Pietila described as a “forward-looking plan to guide the county’s long-term growth”).<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010"><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></span> The department director George Gavrelis “resigned in protest” over the cuts and Anderson fired Gavrelis’ colleague Leslie Graef.<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010"><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></span> A few months later, Anderson “ordered real estate agents to report all sales to blacks to the police” suggesting (without evidence) that “he was acting at the request of the Real Estate Board.”<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010"><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></span> A representative Civil Rights Commission later responded that Anderson’s intention was to: “clearly intimidate rather than help the potential black buyer in the county.”<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010"><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></span></p>
<p>After the Baltimore County City Council first approved urban renewal plans for a largely African American area in East Towson in 1960, voters (following “agitation, coordinated by the extreme right-wing John Birch Society”) defeated the proposals in a 1964 referendum.<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010"><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></span> Pietila observed that even without federal funds, Anderson pursued a “rump renewal program for Towson” that included “a bypass road… flanked by government and commercial offices.” The development, together with the later construction of a high school building, police and fire department headquarters, and Baltimore County jail, displaced much of the East Towson black community. Homes occupied by black households in Catonsville along the Baltimore National Pike and near the new Baltimore Beltway were torn down to make way for “snack shacks and no fewer than ten gasoline stations.”<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010"><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This experience was vividly captured in the 1968 reflections of Hannah Lindsey, an African American resident of Catonsville Pines located immediately next to Route 40 near the Baltimore Beltway. Based on her own seventeen-year experience fighting housing policies and zoning changes harming black residents, Lindsey remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can ride on Route 40 from one end to the other and not find ten service stations in eight tenths of a mile. Except in a Negro area… We’ve lost families out here whose ancestors go back hundreds of years. They give us they—Oh, you don’t want to live on Route 40 anyway, it’s too noisy. We have to live anywhere we can.<span class="citation" data-cites="DiltsChangingCityLiving1968"><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, Baltimore County’s uneven application of zoning changes reportedly “decimated at least twenty old African-American settlements throughout the county.”<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010"><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 id="community-development">Community development</h3>
<p>The shift of Baltimore’s Civil Rights movement to focus on community development was an evolution, not a revolution, from the work of prior decades. After all, affordable housing and public health for African Americans had emerged and remained major concerns for local activists throughout the twentieth century. However, in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, activists saw an influx of financial resources from the city and the federal government to pursue community goals. Others hoped to learn from the failure of “urban renewal” programs in Harlem Park and other neighborhoods in the 1940s and 1950s and sought to place community residents and community-based organizations in more prominent leadership roles.</p>
<p>Community development advocates pursued a range of strategies that worked to meet residents needs within African American communities including job training and the development of affordable housing. New approaches to affordable housing development in this period included partnerships with churches, such as St. James Terrace (1960) and N.M. Carroll Apartments (1978, Leon Bridges, AIA), and rehabilitation of rowhouses including Shields Place (rehabilitated in 1975).<span class="citation" data-cites="IrreplaceableShieldsPlace1975"><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></span> Advocates also sought to work outside black communities and break down barriers to opportunity by fighting continued discrimination and segregation in housing, education, and employment.</p>
<!-- In 1966, CORE's announcement of the "Baltimore Target City Project" attracted national media attention. Although the project failed to deliver on CORE's ambitious announcement, the nation's focus on inequality in Baltimore pushed McKeldin to establish the Mayor's Task Force for Civil Rights (also known as the Baltimore Community Relations Commission) focused on taking action on housing, public accommodations, employment, health and welfare, police-community relations, and education.[@McKeldinStateMayorTheodore1966] -->
<p>A new model for community development began emerging in cities around the country in the late 1960s and early 1970s. One early example is Neighborhood Housing Services (NHS) of Pittsburgh founded in 1968 following years of advocacy by activist Dorothy Mae Richardson. The rise of neighborhood organizing efforts was also influenced by the start of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Areas_Foundation">Industrial Areas Foundation</a> (first established in Chicago by Saul Alinsky in 1940) organizer training program in 1969.</p>
<p>These emerging efforts helped build support for major changes in federal policies around community and economic development. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Opportunity_Act_of_1964">Economic Opportunity Act of 1964</a> established the Community Action Program and the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program. In Baltimore, Linwood Ivey was appointed as the director of the new Community Action Agency (CAA) and continued to lead the succeeding Model City Agency (MCA), and the Urban Services Agency (USA).<span class="citation" data-cites="FaustNeighborhoodMattersWhat2015"><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></span> These public agencies worked to meet the needs of Baltimore residents by bringing city services into city neighborhoods.<span class="citation" data-cites="FaustNeighborhoodMattersWhat2015"><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></span> Baltimore historian and archivist Aiden Faust describes the network of twenty-three neighborhood centers writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These centers were distributed across the city, with higher concentrations in East and West Baltimore, where the poorest neighborhoods were (and still are) concentrated. The centers occupied repurposed churches, storefronts, libraries, public baths, or (in the case of Dunbar) associated with an existing public high school. These diverse settings served as multipurpose centers for many programs and classes for children, teens, senior citizens, young mothers, the homeless, and families in crisis. Food pantries, yoga classes, poetry readings, dance performances, legal assistance, home heating assistance, library services, and many more programmatic offerings coexisted in these spaces.<span class="citation" data-cites="FaustNeighborhoodMattersWhat2015"><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to these neighborhood centers, Model Cities established six “Community Councils” which became seen as “centers of black political activity” and were “eyed with concern by City Councilmen and the local media.” Consequently, in 1976, Lenwood Ivey shut down the Community Councils, a controversial decision that was “decidedly unpopular with residents and Council staff.”<span class="citation" data-cites="FaustNeighborhoodMattersWhat2015"><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Credit_Opportunity_Act">Equal Credit Opportunity Act</a> was approved in 1974 to make it against the law for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant by race, gender. Other policy changes opened new sources of funding. The Community Development Block Grant program was created in 1975, followed by the Tax Reform Act of 1976 which removed preexisting deductions for demolition costs and created new tax incentives to promote the preservation of income-producing historic properties. In 1977, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Reinvestment_Act">Community Reinvestment Act</a> passed to reduce discriminatory practices by commercial banks.</p>
<p>In Baltimore, a variety of new organizations adopted the strategies of the Civil Rights movement to pursue a broader agenda of community development. For example, in August 1968, the Upton Planning Committee threatened a boycott of Lafayette Market (now known as the Avenue Market) on Pennsylvania Avenue in a successful effort to force improvements in the conditions of the market.<span class="citation" data-cites="BOYCOTTSETMARKET1968"><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Grassroots efforts won support from CDBG funding and expanded into more formal organizations, including the Northwest Baltimore Corporation (established in Park Heights in 1971), the Druid Heights Community Development Corporation (originally organized as the Druid Heights Action Association around 1974), the Johnston Square Community Development Corporation, and the Southeast CDC (established in 1975 as Southeast Development, Inc. (SDI) to serve as the development arm of the Southeast Community Organization (SECO)). By 1983, fourteen neighborhood improvement organizations received funding from the Baltimore Department of Housing and Community Development.<span class="citation" data-cites="Lyons71yearoldleadsdetermined1983"><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></span> Churches also played a key role in financing and organizing community development projects, such as Douglass Memorial Community Church, which under the leadership of Rev. Bascom purchased the entire 1300 block of Madison Avenue with “church funds, renovated the buildings, and converted them to low-income housing.”<span class="citation" data-cites="MilobskyPowerPulpitBaltimore1994"><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Other organizations developed to focus on industrial development and citywide concerns. These included the Baltimore Industrial Development Corporation created in 1965, and Baltimore Economic Development Corporation (BEDCO) created in 1975 to manage the city’s industrial land-banking fund.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Another citywide organization was Baltimoreans United In Leadership Development (BUILD) organized in 1977.</p>
<p>The rise of community organizations did not eliminate the conflicts over community development issues. In 1972, Mayor Schaefer appointed George Jude, an African American, to chair the city Planning Commission. But Jude was a staunch supporter of the highway projects that threatened extensive demolition in the city’s African American neighborhoods.<span class="citation" data-cites="MossNEWPLANNINGCHIEF1972"><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></span><!-- TODO: Add more information about the way race split the planning commission. --></p>

<p>The national shift in the movement can also be heard in an April 1967 speech by Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at Riverside Church in New York City where he remarked that Johnson’s “poverty program” offered “a real promise of hope for the poor—both black and white” that, during the build up of the Vietnam War, had been “broken and eviscerated, as if it were some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on war.”<span class="citation" data-cites="KingJr.VietnamTimeBreak1967"><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></span></p>

<p>By late 1969, as the Baltimore Welfare Rights Organization (BWRO) began to grow, Governor Marvin Mandel (then still serving out the remainder of Spiro Agnew’s term after Agnew became Vice-President) moved to abolish the State Board of Social Services as part of a broader plan to move state agencies from a board to a secretary system. Historian Rhonda Williams quotes Barbara Stevenson, the only welfare recipient and woman on the nine-member board, who described the abolition of the board as an “assault on the poor both black and white”, as a possible “means to stop demonstrations and protests” and as an effort to stymie “rapport built with welfare rights’ organizations and other groups.”<span class="citation" data-cites="WilliamsLivingjustenough1998"><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Historian Rhonda Williams describes a campaign from 1966 to 1978 that put the welfare department, housing authority, and city officials “on notice” by “calling attention to its commitment to business and revitalization while ignoring or heaping the burden on the backs of poor people.”<span class="citation" data-cites="WilliamsLivingjustenough1998"><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></span> A “battle cry” issued in 1969 by the NWRO and adopted by local activists clearly articulates their agenda:</p>

<h3 id="business-development">Business development</h3>
<p>Businesses and institutions also responded to the currents of Civil Rights activism. One notable example is Super Pride—a local grocery store chain established by Charles Thurgood Burns (1915-1991) in 1970 when he took over the bankrupt “Super Jet Market” located on East Chase Street. Burns restored the business to profitability within three years—despite encountering food companies that refused to work with a black-owned store. Burns had started in the grocery business around 1921 delivering groceries for the small store his grandfather owned on Dolphin Street. He sold vegetables, produce and fish out of the back of a cart during high school and college then later became the co-owner of Hilton Court Chain of Ethical Pharmacies – a business that according to Burns’ obituary, “catered to the needs of black consumers at a time when white-owned businesses ignored them.”<span class="citation" data-cites="RobinsonCharlesBurnsdies1991"><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></span> Between 1970 and 1990, Super Pride grew to seven locations, employing more than 400 people, and making over $43 million in annual sales. Under Burns’ leadership, Super Pride sponsored Black History Month activities and supported the Arena Players. By the late 1990s, however, the business struggled to compete against national chains and the city’s shrinking population. In the fall of 2000, Super Pride closed all eight of its locations and, in November, held an auction to liquidate the stores and their remaining equipment to satisfy creditors.<span class="citation" data-cites="SentementesSuperPridereaches2000"><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Other black-owned businesses found success in marketing traditional southern cooking as “soul food”. Popular options for local diners included Sampson’s located at 944 W. Fayette Street, the Red Rooster Restaurant and Lounge at 1801 McKean Avenue, and the Yellow Bowl on Greenmount Avenue. According to one 1973 article, soul food was also a regular offering at many of the approximately two hundred storefront churches active in the early 1970s.<span class="citation" data-cites="PietilaStorefrontchurches2001973"><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Another example is found in a March 1971 <em>Sun</em> profile of pharmacist Donald A. Schumer, owner of the forty-year-old Penn-Dol Pharmacy, and his investment in a new building at Pennsylvania Avenue and Dolphin Street.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a>. The report noted Schumer’s sale of the store’s “sundries section to several black employees who had been with him for a number of years” and observed, “The interior of the pharmacy resembles the orderly kind of drug store one expects to find in the affluent white suburbs.”<span class="citation" data-cites="WhiteDocChooses1971"><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></span></p>
<h2 id="criminal-injustice">Criminal injustice</h2>
<p>Police violence continued to be a major concern for local Civil Rights activists. In 1962, one activist recalled the statewide campaign against police violence twenty years early and called on the Governor to establish a similar “blue-ribbon commission.”<span class="citation" data-cites="KeatCOMMISSIONPOLICEBIAS1962"><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></span> The elevation of black police officers to leadership roles, such as Dennis P.

The department also promoted new efforts to improve “community relations” including opening four “Store Front Operations” beginning in July 1967.</p>
<p>Federal funding also played an important role in creating new opportunities for African American residents subject to a discriminatory policing and justice system. By 1970, Baltimore Legal Aid’s budget had grown to $800,000 (over half provided by the federal government) and served nearly 22,000 clients. That same year, Legal Aid started the city’s first public defender office which they continued to operate until 1972 when the state of Maryland created the <a href="http://www.opd.state.md.us/">Office of the Public Defender</a>.<span class="citation" data-cites="MarylandLegalAidBriefHistory2014"><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Despite these efforts, the conflict between the Baltimore City police and African American activists only deepened in this period. Illegal surveillance and efforts to infiltrate and disrupt black activist organizations were a notable area of conflict. Between 1968 and 1974, the Baltimore Police Department Inspectional Services Division (ISD) kept the homes of Parren Mitchell and other African-American politicians and activists under surveillance, illegally bugged home and office telephones, and placed paid informers in congressional campaigns. Beginning in 1971, Parren Mitchell began calling for the resignation of Baltimore Police Commissioner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Pomerleau">Donald Pomerleau</a>. When the ISD surveillance program (and its close ties to the FBI) were revealed, Congressman Mitchell extended his criticism to the ISD.</p>
<p>After Pomerleau’s death in 1992, journalist Michael Olesker <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-01-21/news/1992021065_1_pomerleau-collecting-personal-information-isd">shared a memory</a> of how the Police Commissioner tried to explain away the program and encourage Olesker to drop his investigation in a 1974 conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pomerleau sitting behind his big desk, his head cocked to one side, and he said: “I know you’ve been told we’re collecting personal information on…” and he named several prominent politicians. “Forget it,’‘he said. ’We’re not doing that.’ ‘Wait a minute,’ I said. ‘Are you telling me you’re not collecting personal information on any politicians?’ And here is precisely what Donald Pomerleau replied: ‘Just the blacks. Just the blacks. Just the blacks.’ […] I sat there not believing my ears: Not merely because he was verifying these acts but because, in his arrogance, he would assume he could tell me about it because we shared a skin tone. It was a lie, by the way. His minions were collecting stuff on all sorts of community leaders, and skin color didn’t much matter.<span class="citation" data-cites="OleskerPomerleautookillgotten1992"><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many residents and Civil Rights activists saw little improvement in the accountability of police for violence against black residents. The history of protests at the Western District Police Station at Riggs Avenue and Mount Street help illustrate the significance of these concerns. For example, on August 1, 1966, a group of twenty picketed at the Western District Police Station after “a Municipal Court judge declined to issue warrants charging two patrolmen with assault.”<span class="citation" data-cites="POLICEJUDGEDRAW1966"><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Two hundred and fifty people rallied in August 1969, to “protest the Police Department’s use of dogs and chemical sprays and to demand a civilian police.” The protest was sponsored by the Black United Front, “a coalition of militant and moderate Negro groups” led by activists including Rev. Vernon N. Dobson, president of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, and Parren J. Mitchell.<span class="citation" data-cites="Lynton250HoldRally1969"><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></span> In 1972, a small group of fifteen assembled outside the station to protest an arrest in the 1800 block of Moreland Avenue “claiming the arrest was improper and that the man was beaten by police.”<span class="citation" data-cites="Manarrestprotested1972"><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In December 1973, the Baltimore Community Relations Commission (CRC) voted to “rejoin” the Baltimore Police Department’s Complaint Evaluation Board (CEB) four years after the commission “withdrew from the board, protesting its alleged ineffectiveness in handling complaints of police abuse from civilians.” John Wilson, chief of the commission’s Community Division, recommended against the CRC rejoining the board, remarking, “As long as the police investigate themselves… there is nothing that can be done.”<span class="citation" data-cites="Ending4yearseparation1973"><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Other residents saw a need for more police protection from the violence associated with the growing trade in heroin in the late 1960s and early 1970s. One 1970 article quotes Bertha Jenkins, a resident of the 300 block of E. 21st Street, reflecting on the addiction and violence found in her neighborhood, remarking, “The police don’t patrol around here nearly enough… When you need them, you have to call them.”<span class="citation" data-cites="KochakianDrugTradeThrives1970"><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></span></p>

<p>Arts and cultural spaces took on a new prominence in the broader Civil Rights movement during this period. One local example of how this took place is the New Era Bookstore on the 400 block of Park Avenue (a leftist bookstore associated with the U.S. Communist Party) with one of the “best selections of black-related books and magazines in the city.” During the 1960s, the Knights of Ku Klux Klan and the Fighting American Nationalists picketed the bookstore and, in 1967, opponents broke the building’s windows and attempted to light it on fire with a burning can of gasoline.<span class="citation" data-cites="NewEracloses1994"><a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></span></p>
<p>One regular visitor to the New Era Bookstore was African American poet Sam Cornish. In 1966, Cornish began working as the editor of <em><a href="http://collections.digitalmaryland.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/mdcy">Chicory</a></em>, a magazine of poetry and art by Baltimore residents, published by the Enoch Pratt Free Library with funding from the federal Office of Economic Opportunity’s Community Action Program (later listing the library’s Urban Services Program at 31 S. Payson Street as the offices of the magazine). Evelyn Levy, Supervisor of Library Services for the Community Action Program, and Thelma Bell, one of the first African American children’s librarians at Pratt, led the effort which continued to publish up to ten issues each year until 1983.<!-- Citation missing! --></p>
<p>African American visual artists also played an important role. When Mayor William Donald Schaefer launched the city’s first mural program in September 1973 with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, the jury included James Lewis, a professor of Morgan State and founder of the James E. Lewis Museum of Art. One of the ten murals commissioned by the project was located on the back of the Afro-American newspaper building at Druid Hill Avenue and Jasper Street showing “a stylized pair of black dancers frozen on a white background.”<!-- Citation missing! --></p>
<p>Music was also used as a strategy to bridge differences between white and black Baltimoreans with efforts including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Bank_Jazz_Society">Left Bank Jazz Society</a> (established in 1964) and a series of concerts organized by Rev. Chester Wickwire at Johns Hopkins University. In a 2006 oral history, Wickwire described the culture of discriminatory and how, beginning in 1959, he sought to “change Hopkins, desegregate it” by organizing performances by jazz and rock musicians that appealed to interracial audiences including Dave Brubeck, Charles Mingus, Joan Baez, Duke Ellington, Thelonius Monk, Mothers of Invention. In his efforts to end segregation on the Hopkins campus, Wickwire recalled: “Jazz helped us.”<span class="citation" data-cites="WickwireRevChesterWickwire2006"><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></span></p>

<h3 id="african-american-heritage-preservation-efforts">African American heritage preservation efforts</h3>
<p>This push to build new roads through largely African American neighborhoods met with strong resistance by anti-highway activists and from black Baltimoreans seeking to preserve historic places associated with African American history in Baltimore. In some cases, they found allies with Baltimore Heritage established in 1960, the Baltimore Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation (CHAP) established in 1964, the Maryland Historical Trust (MHT) established in 1966, and the Commission on Negro History and Culture (later renamed the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture (MCAAHC)) established in 1969.</p>
<p>The most prominent of these early efforts was the Committee for the Preservation of Orchard Street Church, organized in the fall of 1972 and led by Mrs. W.A.C. Hughes.<span class="citation" data-cites="Historicregistrationbe1972 OldChurch1973 PietilaBlackstatehistory1974 ArnettChurchslavetunnel1976"><a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></span><!-- Add more detail on the Orchard Street Church preservation efforts. --> The National Register of Historic Places provided an important tool for recognizing and protecting African American landmarks including Orchard Street United Methodist Church (designated November 12, 1975), Public School No. 111 at N. Carrollton Avenue and Riggs Road (designated September 25, 1979), Cummins Memorial Church at 1210 W. Lanvale Street (designated October 31, 1979), and the Sharp Street Memorial United Methodist Church and Community House (designated July 21, 1982). In the 1970s, CHAP designated several local landmarks associated with African American history in Baltimore including Bethel A.M.E. Church (1300 Druid Hill Avenue) and Ebenezer A.M.E. Church (18 W. Montgomery Street) in 1971 and Sharon Baptist Church (1373 N. Stricker Street) and First Baptist Church (525 N. Caroline Street) in 1977. CHAP designated Madison Park as the city’s first historic district occupied largely by African American residents also in 1977.</p>

<p>Other cultural organizations also changed to reflect rising black political and social power. One example is the Negro War Heroes Monument commissioned in 1968 and installed at Monument Square on Calvert Street, despite some opposition, in 1971.<span class="citation" data-cites="KeidelMonumentHonorAmerican1968 Protestsmaybar1971"><a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></span> Another example is found at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, Branch 17 (known at present as the Pennsylvania Avenue Branch library) where librarians organized a program on Langston Hughes in the summer of 1969:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest attractions at Branch 17 are books on job opportunities and books about Negro history and culture. Miss Lillie Story, administrative assistant at the branch, said that the big increase in demand for the latter books has come since the 1968 Baltimore riots.<span class="citation" data-cites="ArnettEveningLangstonHughes1969"><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- In July 1967, again according to [Baltimore Police History](http://baltimorecitypolicehistory.com/), the Baltimore City Police established the first of four "Community Relations Store Front Operations" noting: "The purpose of these centers is to reach the community on an intimate basis. This was the first such project in the Northeastern region of the United States." On a visit to Baltimore around this time, Bayard Rustin observed:

> A society that refuses to give some of its people equal rights and opportunities creates frustrations whose brunt is thrown at the police because they are the obvious protectors of an unjust order. <!-- Citation missing but I think it is from a Baltimore Community Relations Commission report, 1966 or 67-->
