        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In <em>PRECURSORS OF ROSA PARKS: MARYLAND TRANSPORTATION CASES BETWEEN THE CIVIL WAR AND THE BEGINNING OF WORLD WAR I</em>, historian David Bogen reflected on the importance of early activism around transportation and public accommodation, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Rosa Parks refused to move to a seat in the back of the bus in Montgomery, it sparked a boycott and was a critical event in the Civil Rights movement.’ But Mrs. Parks was not the first African American to resist segregation. Mary Anderson, Aaron Bradley, Josephine Carr, Harriet E. Cully, John W. Fields, Professor W. H.H. Hart, Ellen Jackson, Annie A. Jakes, James Jenkins, Reverend Harvey Johnson, Reverend Robert McGuinn, the Stewart sisters, Alexander Thompson, and Thomas W. Turner were among the many teachers, ministers, businessmen, and ordinary citizens who refused to accept second class treatment on Maryland’s waterways and rails.<span class="citation" data-cites="bogen_precursors_2004"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One category of public accommodation that deserves special note is the relationship of public accommodation to public health. This may involve access to hospitals, health centers or the offices of professional physicians but also has a broader meaning for the way in which black people were conceived as a threat to public health at various times.</p>

<li>1968 – 1976</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="section">1831 – 1870</h1>
<p>In 1841, efforts to end Jim Crow segregation in northern cities began:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 1841, intense efforts to end Jim Crow cars began. Black abolitionists like Frederick Douglass refused to move to the Jim Crow car and did so only after being physically removed from their seats.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Baltimore and other Southern cities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For southern blacks, segregation was not always legally or rigidly enforced. However, Negroes generally could not enter hotels and restaurants, and in some locations faced discrimination in public conveyances. Overall, they were separated from whites in public buildings if accommodated at all. In Charleston, Richmond, and Savannah, blacks could enter public grounds and gardens only during certain hours or were restricted all together. At times separate institution building for blacks occurred (albeit for the economic advantage of white business owners).<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Precursors of Rosa Parks, David Bogen remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prior to the Civil War, segregation in transportation was primarily a Northern phenomenon, which was on the decline. In the South, slaves rode with their masters so as to be available to provide services, while laws to prevent escapes discouraged solo travel by blacks of any status. If transportation facilities did not exclude free blacks, they were likely to segregate the few who traveled. Slavery’s abolition was swiftly accompanied by the rise of broader segregation. The enactment of the Civil Rights Act on April 9, 1866, spurred African-American resistance. The Act provided that citizens of every race and color were entitled to the same right to make and enforce contracts as was enjoyed by white citizens. This created a plausible argument that discrimination in offering contracts for public accommodations violated the federal statute.<span class="citation" data-cites="bogen_precursors_2004"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between 1865 and 1867, “Black codes” adopted widely in the South:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From 1865 to 1867, blacks were restricted from insane asylums, orphanages, poorhouses, institutions for the deaf and dumb, and either prohibited from first class rail cars or required segregated cars.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="section-1">1870 – 1905</h1>
<p>David Bogen summarizes the Baltimore City Passenger Railway cases, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About one car in three permitted African Americans to ride, but the railway permitted whites to ride in all cars. In February of 1871, John W. Fields, a black barber visiting Baltimore from Virginia, was ejected from a car that did not have such a sign. He responded by filing suit in United States circuit court, with Mr. Presstman as his attorney. The case was tried before Judge Giles and Judge Hugh Lennox Bond (appointed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals by President Ulysses Grant as a reward for his conduct during the Civil War and on the bench in Baltimore). Judge Bond charged the jury that if the company refused to transport Fields solely because he was black, he should be awarded damages. That charge marked the end of segregation on horsecar trolleys, because afterwards the trolley companies found it too expensive to have separate cars for African Americans in the same numbers and with the same convenience as cars restricted to whites. Thus, Fields’ victory integrated municipal transit in Baltimore.<span class="citation" data-cites="bogen_precursors_2004"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>NPS report notes: “Streetcar exclusion and segregation became an increasingly contentious area of southern race relations that did not go unchallenged.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall, between 1868 and 1873, seven southern states enacted civil rights laws to end segregated transportation. […] Some cities outside the South witnessed success in legally challenging segregation. Between 1865 and 1873, cases in Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Chicago found segregation unlawful on certain conveyances. During the late nineteenth century mixed southern streetcar seating generally “remained the rule” only to be segregated again at the turn of the century.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="first-anti-segregation-ruling-by-the-u.s.-supreme-court">1873: First anti segregation ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court</h2>
<p>In 1873, the U.S. Supreme Court made its first anti-segregation ruling in a railroad case when a black woman was forced to leave the car reserved for whites to an equal car reserved for blacks.</p>
<h2 id="hall-v.-decuir">1877: Hall v. DeCuir</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1877, the Court unanimously ruled in the case of Hall v. DeCuir that state laws were not applicable to interstate vessels and that only Congress could regulate interstate commerce. The Court had reasoned that varying state regulations would be a burden on interstate commerce. Thus, states could not require interstate carriers to offer integrated facilities.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="decision-in-civil-rights-cases-declares-civil-rights-act-of-1875-unconstitutional">1883: Decision in Civil Rights cases declares Civil Rights Act of 1875 unconstitutional</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In declaring the Civil Rights Act of 1875 unconstitutional, the Court said that the act was not authorized by either the Thirteenth or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. In essence, the Court found that individuals were protected from the infringement of their civil rights by federal and state governments, but not by other individuals. In his dissent, Justice John M. Harlan argued that the Thirteenth Amendment “did something more than to prohibit slavery as an institution,” and that Congress was authorized under the Fourteenth Amendment to pass laws governing both individual and state action in the field of civil rights.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In response to the prohibition on federal action, some states passed state laws:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between 1884 and 1887, Ohio, Nebraska, Indiana, Rhode Island, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts enacted provisions to prohibit discrimination based on race in accommodations and/or conveyances. New York, in 1893, added cemeteries as a place of no color distinction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why did the Civil Rights Act of 1875 fail to protect public accommodations from segregation?</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of black resistance was one of the reasons for the failure of a sustained opposition to segregation.</li>
<li>Another reason was based on making a living. Black business owners with a white clientele were hesitant to serve other blacks for fear of losing white business.</li>
<li>While for others it meant losing their jobs should they choose to challenge access.</li>
<li>Lastly, some blacks viewed the prospect of equal separate facilities as an improvement over exclusion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="congress-of-the-interstate-commerce-act-of-1887-established-icc-icc-upheld-separate-but-equal-facilities">1887: Congress of the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 established ICC, ICC upheld “separate but equal” facilities</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Separate but equal” became the basic framework of Jim Crow legislation. Between 1887 and 1892, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Maryland, North Carolina, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia all enacted new segregation and discrimination laws.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>These efforts had already suffered a setback in the U.S. Supreme Court in 1890, when the Court upheld a Mississippi law that required separate accommodations for blacks and whites in Louisville, New Orleans, and Texas Railway Company v. Mississippi.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="plessy-v.-ferguson">1896: Plessy v. Ferguson</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1896, the Supreme Court decided against Plessy. Justice Henry Billings Brown writing for the majority concluded that legislative bodies were “powerless to eradicate racial instincts,” and that “if one race be inferior to the other socially, the Constitution of the United States cannot put them on the same plane.” Equal rights did not necessitate the “enforced commingling of the two races.”<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="section-2">1905 – 1929</h1>
<p>Expansion of segregation throughout the South:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While only three states required segregated waiting rooms prior to 1899, within the next decade several other states followed. Other laws excluded blacks from Pullman cars, steamboats, and streetcars. Trolley car segregation in particular continued to be a major object of black protest.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="s-efforts-to-enact-segregation-on-baltimore-city-trolleys">1910s: Efforts to enact segregation on Baltimore City trolleys</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, a Jim Crow rail coach law did squeak through the Maryland legislature in 1904 despite the heroic and nearly successful resistance efforts of Dr. Lyon on the eve of his departure to Liberia. A boycott and a lawsuit by well-to do blacks from Maryland and Washington D.C. later restricted it to intra-state travel only. Other Jim Crow statutes, such as a Baltimore City trolley segregation ordinance, languished into the mid-1910s, with the NAACP and Ashbee Hawkins fighting them every step of the way.<span class="citation" data-cites="nightingale_transnational_2006"><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boycott in Maryland was one of many in this period:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between 1900 and 1906, twenty-five southern cities experienced streetcar boycotts. At the turn of the century many city or state ordinances required streetcar segregation in the states of Georgia, Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and North Carolina. Boycotts lasted anywhere from weeks to up to three years and protests occurred in all the former Confederate states.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span></p>

<p>How did segregation and progressive politics related?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But this period of social protest and economic reform was limited to the benefit of the white world at a time of pervasive Negro disfranchisement and all-out state sponsored discrimination. In writing on Wilsonian segregation, historian Nancy Weiss noted that “white America linked Progressive democracy and equality to greater separation from Negroes.”<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>

<h2 id="prayer-meeting-at-stewart-co.">1916: Prayer meeting at Stewart &amp; Co.</h2>
<p>In July 1916, African American porters held a prayer meeting in the sun parlor of the Stewart &amp; Co. building at Howard and Lexington Streets, led by porter Rev. John E. Green. The account in the Afro suggested that this is the first meeting of its kind “in a public building where colored help is employed.”</p>
<h1 id="section-3">1929 – 1954</h1>
<p>Segregation continues to expand in many places during the 1920s and 1930s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 1920s and 1930s gave way to segregation on local and long distance buses. In the 1930s, Jim Crow laws became effective on buses and in bus depots in eleven southern states. While segregation by airline companies did not last, southern airport terminals segregated their facilities through either custom or by law in the 1930s and 1940s.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></span></p>

<h2 id="july-1929-afro-newspaper-campaign-against-segregated-buses">July 1929: Afro newspaper campaign against segregated buses</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1929, the Afro launched a campaign to “place responsibility for jim-crow buses operated by the Baltimore United Street Railway company” with the policy of instructing bus drivers to “tell Negroes they can’t ride, but don’t put them off.” reporter from the Afro attempted to catch the bus at Howard &amp; Mulberry.</p>

<h2 id="irene-morgan-case">1946: Irene Morgan Case</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the meantime, given the importance of the transportation problem for black civilians as well as military personnel, the NAACP prepared a concerted attack against segregation. Its attorneys sought to prove that state segregation laws requiring separate facilities imposed an unconstitutional hardship on interstate commerce. A golden opportunity arose on July 16, 1944, when Irene Morgan of Baltimore, Maryland was returning home from Virginia aboard a Greyhound Bus. […] Following this trend, on June 3, 1946, the court declared in Morgan v. Virginia that Virginia’s segregation law interfered with Morgan’s freedom to travel across state lines.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>

<h2 id="henderson-v.-united-states">1950: Henderson v. United States</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>On June 5, 1950, a unanimous bench in Henderson v. United States did not go as far as the Justice Department wanted, but found in Henderson’s favor. The court held that the railroad’s revised practice still did not grant blacks equal access to dining facilities, because if some blacks filled the allotted table and others desired to eat, they remained barred from sitting at tables reserved for whites.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress in public accommodations remained halting as long as desegregation emerged on a case-by-case basis. By the end of 1950, blacks generally could claim access to first-class railroad cars. However, most African Americans traveled in second-class coaches, which court decisions had not addressed. As far as bus travel, despite the ruling in Morgan, and as the experience of the Journey of Reconciliation had shown, southern bus lines continued to practice segregation in interstate and intrastate travel. What desegregation existed was confined mainly to the Upper South and Border States.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Committee On Racial Equality, (CORE), the Urban league, and the Americans for Democratic Action, (ADA), more stores in the 200 block W. Lexington st. are realizing there is no color line in the dollars you spend. Lunch counters and restaurants in the Kresge and Woolworth Five and Ten have been serving all customers for several weeks. McCrory’s has just reversed its policy and will serve all comers… Schulte United in the 200 block Lexington is still acting silly.&quot;</p>

<p>To this end, on December 14, 1953, the NAACP petitioned the ICC to void all segregation rules promulgated by transportation companies and applied to the facilities they maintained. Shortly after, on May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court issued its landmark opinion in Brown v. Board of Education, which outlawed public school segregation. In conformity with this ruling, on November 7, 1955, the ICC announced that the separate but equal doctrine was dead with respect to interstate transportation.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span></p>

<p>Context around the U.S.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the 1950s, a number of northern and western states adopted legislation prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations. Joining the eighteen states with such laws already on the books were Oregon (1953), Montana (1955), New Mexico (1955), Vermont (1957), Maine (1957), Idaho (1959), and Alaska (1959). In 1961, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming brought the total number of states with anti-segregations statutes up to twenty-eight. In addition, several cities in states that did not have public accommodations laws passed their own versions, including Wilmington, Delaware; Baltimore, Maryland; St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri; and El Paso, Texas.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the 1950s some progress had been made as CORE led sit-ins to desegregate downtown variety store lunch counters, and students from Morgan State College, a black school, desegregated lunch counters at Read’s Drug Store in the Northwood Shopping Center, located a mile from the college. By the time of the Greensboro demonstrations, the main public accommodations still segregated consisted of beauty shops, restaurants, and the women’s apparel sections of department stores. In 1960, Morgan State College students, organized under the banner of the Civic Interest Group, conducted protests at the Hecht-May store restaurant in Northwood and at Hutzler’s department store restaurant. The disciplined group of students and their allies attracted a good deal of support from both the black and white communities. After three weeks of demonstrations, the department stores capitulated and abandoned segregation, pursuing their own best economic interests by reaching a solution.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span></p>

<h2 id="maryland-adopts-a-public-accommodations-law">1963: Maryland adopts a public accommodations law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The most vexing problem in this respect concerned the treatment non-white African officials received while traveling along Maryland’s Highway 40, which they rode en route from the U.N. in New York City to Washington, D.C. On numerous occasions, the diplomats stopped for a meal at a Maryland restaurant, which denied them service as it did for African Americans. Brought to the attention of President Kennedy, he initially remarked: “Tell these ambassadors I wouldn’t think of driving from New York to Washington. Tell them to fly!” Nevertheless, the Kennedy Administration did try to tackle the problem. The Office of Special Protocol Services within the State Department took the unusual step of sending its director, Pedro A. Sanjuan, to testify before the Maryland legislature in support of a public accommodations bill under consideration. Normally, state legislatures did not hear from State Department officials in the course of their duties. However, Sanjuan made it clear that the struggle for racial democracy within Maryland was explicitly linked to the country’s ability to conduct the Cold War. “GIVE US THE WEAPONS TO CONDUCT THIS WAR ON HUMAN DIGNITY,” he insisted, which the battle against communism demanded.196 Despite initial reluctance, Maryland adopted a public accommodations law in January 1963, thereby assisting American citizens of color and non-white foreigners alike and providing more ammunition for the nation’s Cold War propaganda arsenal.<span class="citation" data-cites="salvatore_civil_2004"><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></span></p>
