  abstract = {```To Strike for Right, To Strike With Might': African Americans and the Struggle for Civil Rights in Baltimore, 1910\textendash{}1930'' examines the nature, character and scope of early civil rights activism among African Americans in Baltimore, Maryland. Utilizing an expansive definition of ``civil rights'', it explores not only voting and holding political office, access to public education, and fair housing opportunities; it also considers struggles for access to municipal and social services and struggles related to labor and employment. By placing all of these terrains of struggle under the umbrella of ``civil rights'', the dissertation emphasizes the importance of these rights in relation to one another and their importance in the minds and lives of African Americans who struggled for rights in each of these categories as part of a broader struggle for equality.
Baltimore has long been recognized for its civil rights activism by scholars who portray the era of the 1930s to 1950s as a kind of ``golden age'' of civil rights activism in the city, considering such activism to have been dormant prior to that period. The dissertation reveals an active civil rights movement in the city in the decades preceding the 1930s that was led primarily by members of the middle-class but drew widespread support and strength from members of all classes in Baltimore's African American community. In uncovering the civil rights activism of the period from 1910 to 1930, the dissertation brings to the forefront previously ignored organizations, including the Federation of Parent-Teacher Clubs, the Women's Cooperative Civic League, the Independent Republican League, and the Baltimore Urban League. It also reveals that the activism of the period from 1910 to 1930 was important in launching major civil rights campaigns of national organizations such as the NAACP, whose residential segregation campaign had roots in the fight in Baltimore. Throughout, the dissertation explores the ways that black Baltimoreans defined priorities and struggled for rights, resulting in a more nuanced understanding of African Americans' struggles for citizenship and equality at beginning of the twentieth century.},

She is reflective of a multitude of women who buttressed the Movement through behind-the-scene activism, such as fundraising, and voter registrations. However, like many other women who worked with the Civil Rights Movement her activism was not limited to civil rights. Rather Victorine Adams worked with a number of secular and religious groups to create equality, to provide resources for women and girls, and to assist people in poverty.
The addition of her life to the historical record expands the understanding of the Civil Rights Movement as a dynamic process connected to other movements for change and justice; that it was a movement that spanned much longer than the 1950s and 1960s. It reflects the complicated nature of the fight for equality as Adams' husband, William L. Adams, former illegal gambling runner, and later one of the wealthiest men in Baltimore through his venture capitalist business, financially supports Victorine's activism along with others in Baltimore. It also adds support to the idea that religion needs to be included in an understanding of many of the men and women who worked with the Civil Rights Movement.},

  abstract = {The search for the origins of the civil rights movement has moved to the grassroots level. Initial studies indicate that local blacks and their communities in the Deep South and Upper South began mobilizing for civil rights as early as the early 1940s. To date, nobody has studied black community mobilization in the Border South or the role of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in this historical process. This dissertation, a case study of the origins and early development of the civil rights movement in Baltimore, attempts to fill these historiographical voids.
The story of Baltimore's civil rights movement begins with the coalescence of Baltimore's black community in response to segregation. Young blacks coming of age in the midst of the Great Depression organized the City-Wide Young People's Forum, and in their search for equal employment opportunities they renewed the struggle for black civil rights in Baltimore. A buy-where-you-can-work boycott mobilized black community support and showcased future local and national civil rights leaders. Afterwards, local activists teamed with the national office of the NAACP to fight segregation at the University of Maryland and to revive the Baltimore branch of the NAACP. Black Baltimoreans continued their civil rights struggle through the Baltimore NAACP, and they spread the movement to other parts of Maryland, while working with the national NAACP lawyers to experiment with desegregating high schools and equalizing teachers' salaries. By 1942, Baltimore's civil rights leaders were able to mobilize and lead 150 community organizations and 2,000 citizens on a March on Annapolis to protest police brutality. Thus, we find that Baltimore, a Border South city, was in the vanguard of the civil rights movement at both the grassroots and national levels before America's participation in World War II.},

  abstract = {In 1937, the Baltimore city police department hired its first African-American officer. Her hire and the subsequent hire, seven months later, of four black male officers represented the culmination of nearly two decades of civil rights activism by a coalition of print media, middle-class reformers, and cooperative politicians.
I argue that civil rights activity in Baltimore, especially in the first half of the twentieth century, was generally nonviolent and led by a strong-willed, generally secular cadre of middle-class African Americans. In addition, because of its border state status, racial gains occurred earlier in Baltimore than they did in Dixie, but not as early as they did in more northern cities. The leaders of Baltimore's civil rights movement used their political and journalistic influence to call for and effect change. The process of desegregating the city's police department is a clear example of this.
I begin with a general narrative of the campaign for desegregation between 1920 and 1950. Using the reporting and editorializing of the Baltimore Afro-American, I explain the importance of desegregation to the community, not only as a tangible example of racial progress, but as acknowledgment of the rising civic power of African-American Baltimoreans.
I explore issues related to the police department and its integration, including the racial and sexual power dynamics inherent between any police force and its community, especially in the United States in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. I also examine the economic class of the activists and the first few officers as a means of reiterating the fundamentally middle-class nature of this particular civil rights campaign.},

  abstract = {This study examines the role of the Catholic Church in Baltimore's African-American community focusing on one institution in particular--St. Peter Claver Catholic Church and its West Baltimore community. Dedicated in 1888, the church has played an important role for over 118 years, contributing to the religious, educational, and social aspects of its congregation and the surrounding community. Specifically, this study examines the church's role in the community during the civil rights era as well as its post-desegregation efforts to develop alternatives in education, housing, and social conditions, which would help it survive and continue to serve those left in its declining parish and community.
This study provides an overview of the role of St. Peter Claver in the African-American community, including its history and development as a parish. This study explores how the church served the members of its parish and contributed to the social change that occurred during the turbulent time of the civil rights movement, including the involvement of parish members and priests in local and national protest and activities. It discuses how the legal and social victories of the civil rights movement contributed to the desegregation of residential communities as well as public and private accommodations, which in turn contributed to the decline in the stability of the community that the church served.
Further, the study examines the strategies that St. Peter Claver developed including participating in cluster schools, developing partnerships with non-Catholic community organizations and organizing new ministries to fit the changing needs of the impoverished community it served, while continuing its dedication and mission to convert souls for Christ and to serve and educate African-Americans. The activities of its members and priests are viewed as a collective endeavor and the impact of the civil rights era and desegregation is evaluated by its effect on the church and its ministries as a whole.
This study uses a conventional narrative to present findings of primary sources from the archives of The Society of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart (Josephite archives) that started the St. Peter Claver Parish and oral interviews. This study exposes aspects of an African-American Catholic church experience during the civil rights era, desegregation period, and decline of its community. The thesis highlights the trials, spirit, determination, and triumphs of St. Peter Claver Catholic Church of Baltimore.},

  abstract = {"No Road to Renaissance: Black Protest and Downtown Expansion in Baltimore 1954-1977" examines African American postwar protest movements and community building during the redevelopment of downtown Baltimore. The period analyzed, 1954-1977, is considered the traditional era of the Civil Rights /Black Power movement. This research highlights the evolution of a power struggle between the city's power elite and black residents over the racial and class makeup of the city.
This dissertation's thesis is that year of 1954, the time of the Brown v. Board decision issued by the U.S. Supreme Court, was the beginning of challenges for control between city politicians and business leaders political and the African American community over housing, land, electoral politics, public and social spaces, and legislation in relation to downtown expansion. However, the power struggle was not a long or continuous. There were distinctions of such protest campaigns before and after the 1954 Brown v. Board decision. In Baltimore, from 1954 through 1965, the black middle class, local civil rights organizations, and student activists engaged in blockbusting, voter registration, black electoral politics, and student sit-ins in downtown department stores. Although these measures never challenged downtown urban planning directly, they changed the racial and class makeup of a city. Beginning in 1966, black grassroots organizations and working class white communities directly challenged legislation and urban planners that related to downtown redevelopment. Such campaigns included the protest for the stability of neighborhoods threatened by massive highways and exclusion from the decision making process of the creation downtown projects such as the Charles Center/ Inner Harbor.
The vision of a post-industrial economy in Baltimore was created by downtown businessmen and city politicians that consisted of corporate services and tourism via Charles Center/Inner Harbor as an attempt to draw upper class white residents from the Maryland suburbs back into the city. From 1954 through 1960, the effect of blockbusting practices and the growing voting strength within black city districts in West Baltimore led to the first city-wide hysteria over the changing racial profile of the city. From 1960 through 1964, at the time of the creation of the Charles Center, Morgan State College student activists desegregated all downtown department stores and restaurants while the black middle class residents challenged housing developers and politicians over segregated housing near the downtown area. From 1966 through 1977, downtown urban planning was challenged directly by black grassroots activists over displacement of blacks from areas near the central business district. Meanwhile, black and white anti-highway organizations protested the East-West Expressway.
This study shows how important the national Civil Rights Movement, beginning with the 1954 Brown v. Board decision, had an influence on an urban center like Baltimore. Moreover, the Modern Civil Rights/Black Power Movement is "periodized" in the time frame of 1954 through 1977. This study also shows the role that U.S. government played in urban affairs, how the transformation of a local economy impacted the lives and communities of black residents, and how blacks responded exclusion and exploitation. Downtown expansion and postwar social movements in Baltimore is presented as a prototype of how to place downtown reconstruction into the historiography of African American Urban History since World War II.},

  abstract = {Working For the Race: The Transformation of the Civil Rights Struggle in Baltimore, 1929\textendash{}1945, traces the evolution of African American civil rights organizations, and the efforts of middle-class leaders to incorporate working-class concerns into their political programs. The period 1929 to 1945 stands as one of the key social and political eras in the history of Baltimore. During these sixteen years, civil rights activists debated whether or not their chances for success would be better if they formed alliances with radical political organizations, concentrated on intraracial campaigns, or placed their hopes in the policies of the federal government. Ultimately, African American activists in Baltimore tried all three of these strategies, incorporating aspects of their political campaigns, and reformulating them in a way that was more responsive to the immediate concerns of their community, be they mob violence or the treatment of workers in the steel mill.
Chapter one focuses the relationship between the Baltimore branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Afro American newspaper, and the Communist Party. Chapter two moves the discussion from specific organizations to the incidents of mob violence on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Chapter three examines the African American community's response to Communist Party programs, and the emergence of a youth movement that would ultimately lead to the resurgence of political activism among black Baltimoreans. Chapter four marks the period when middle-class leaders in the African American community directed their attention away from the Communists and focused on working with New Deal agencies during the Great Depression.
Chapter five traces the re-emergence of the Baltimore NAACP, its conflicts with the Communist Party, and its campaign to desegregate higher education. Chapter six examines the relationship between the African American community and Congress of Industrial Organizations at Bethlehem Steel's Sparrows Point plant and its three major shipyards in the area. Working with both the Fair Employment Practices Committee and the CIO, civil rights leaders were able to break through racial barriers that had historically confined African Americans to the least paying and least desirable jobs.},

This case illustrates how African-Americans in Baltimore began to achieve their full-fledged Civil Rights by using the concept of unfair employment practices as a stepping stone for achieving complete racial integration nationally.
This paper will examine this case from a Black Nationalist perspective and will emphasize the 1945 District Court of Maryland case, analyzing its impact in assisting African-Americans in Baltimore to achieve progress educationally or occupationally. This study is based on primary sources including reports in the Baltimore Sun and the Afro-American newspapers, law reviews, articles and other primary sources such as legal dockets, letters, report cards and receipts. In addition, Louise Kerr the defendant of the case and Law Professor Larry Gibson were interviewed to help provide essential information to this work.
This study is important because it illustrates how Kerr and her community helped to lay the groundwork for later Civil Rights achievements in American courts. The Kerr v. Pratt (1945) raised major questions about race, segregation and institutional discrimination in the Baltimore public sector. Hence, its ramifications were far-reaching and received national acclaim as it contributed to the renowned Brown v. Board of Education (1954). This case shows how ordinary citizens like Louise Kerr and prominent jurist like Charles Hamilton Houston worked together to bring social and economic change to the oppressed community of Baltimore.},

  abstract = {This thesis chronicles the process of the desegregation of public recreation spaces in Baltimore from 1935-1956. The struggle against segregated public parks in Baltimore shows how actions by everyday people often set the agenda for the actions of institutional organizations like the NAACP, and how such efforts create social change in spaces outside of mandated areas of societal interactions. Without the general public supporting integration for themselves, places like parks would remain effectively segregated, even after discriminatory policies were removed.
While a significant portion of this project relates to legal cases, these cases were brought forth only after protest actions by individuals and community-based organizations. The fight culminated in the official desegregation of public park facilities in 1955. Newspaper reports and the official minutes of the Baltimore Bureau of Recreation and Parks uncover the events of these protests; oral histories to bring to light the individual motivations which propelled such actions. Finally, local newspaper reports, oral histories, and published accounts of the events also create a broader picture of how the various communities in Baltimore viewed the fight to desegregate the public parks.},

  abstract = {This dissertation explores roots of the current urban crisis in the United States. Most scholarly explanations associate the problem, particularly of high levels of African-American poverty, with deindustrialization, which has stripped cities of the factory jobs that once sustained working-class communities. My account deviates from the standard tale of black male unemployment by focusing on shifting patterns of African-American women's labor\textemdash{}both paid and unpaid. Using Baltimore as a case study, it argues that public rather than industrial-sector employment served as the foundation of Baltimore's post-World War II African-American middle and working classes. Women outpaced men in winning government jobs. Concentrated in social welfare agencies, they used their new influence over public policy to improve the city's delivery of public services. Black women's efforts to build an infrastructure for sustainable community development put them at odds in municipal policy-making battles with city officials and business leaders intent upon revitalizing Baltimore through investment in a tourism industry. The social services workers scored some important victories, helping to alleviate poverty by shifting to the government some of the responsibility for health, child, and elder care women earlier provided in the private sphere. The conservative ascendancy of the 1970s and 1980s, reversed many of the gains African-American public-sector workers had won. Intent upon resuscitating the United States' status in the global economy, American presidents, influenced by conservative economists and their elite backers, made macroeconomic and urban policy decisions that justified extensive public-sector retrenchment and cuts or changes to social programs. Public-sector workers and their unions, most notably the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), fought with limited success to prevent the transformation of American public policy. Neoliberal policies eroded African-American women's authority within the state. Job losses hit hardest the agencies in which they worked. Meanwhile, program cuts and changes in eligibility requirements left many poor and working-poor women to attempt to provide themselves services for their families recently available from the state. The changes plunged Baltimore into the most acute phase of the urban crisis.},

  abstract = {The issue of school desegregation in America has received attention from scholars who have examined the phenomenon within the context of Civil Rights activism during which under the auspices of the NAACP, Thurgood Marshall successfully argued against practices of racial segregation in schools. Widely known accounts of school integration, such as the Little Rock Nine event in 1957, have been highlighted when dissecting the challenges African American students faced after the 1954 Brown v. The Board of Education, Topeka, Kansas decision to end school segregation. This thesis examines the effects of school desegregation on Frederick Douglass High School (FDHS) in Baltimore City. Frederick Douglass High School, the first all-Black high school in Baltimore City, developed out of the need to educate the city's youth beyond the primary grades, and help to shape and produce black professionals. In the decades following school desegregation, significant changes in the demographics of the neighborhoods in which many of the high school's students lived and the attendant social ills, negatively affected the culture and attitude of the students of the school. Therefore, during desegregation, the school progressively came to be comprised of a population of students who dealt with communal dysfunctions that posed significant barriers to the school in terms of discipline, attendance and the educational development of its students.},

  abstract = {This dissertation examines the struggle for racial equality in urban fire departments from the late 19th century to the present. The first half contains extensive case studies of Black experiences in the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) and Baltimore City Fire Department (BFD). Particular emphasis is given to the process of Black inclusion, day-to-day and institutional race relations, and the backgrounds and experiences of Black firefighters in each fire department. The activities of local branches of national civil rights organizations such as the National Urban League and the NAACP, as well as the involvement of local Black political leaders in the struggle for Black inclusion and equal opportunity are chronicled, as are the activities of the Vulcan Society in New York and the Social Association of Fire Fighters in Baltimore.
The second half of the dissertation explores the nationalization of the struggle for equal employment opportunity within the urban fire service. The 1970 formation of the International Association of Black Professional Fire Fighters (IABPFF), its relationship to the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), and the struggle for "community control" and Black representation within urban fire departments as well as the impact of Title VII, the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Caucus and Black Power movements, and urban rebellions on the organization's formation and objectives are examined. The evolution, implementation, limitations, and strengths of equal opportunity litigation and remedial relief programs as applied to urban fire departments, the activities of Black firefighters' organizations, the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), municipal governments, the Department of Justice, and the federal courts during the course of fire department litigation are also documented and analyzed.},

  shorttitle = {"{{Working}} on Many Levels},
  abstract = {This thesis is a place-based social and intellectual history of the second-wave feminist movement that lived and worked in Waverly and Charles Village, two adjacent neighborhoods in northeastern Baltimore. ```Working on Many Levels:' Second-Wave Feminism in Baltimore'' investigates the events and institutions organized and created by feminist and other social movement actors, and analyzes the political content of their activism and discourse. Sources include oral history interviews, underground and mainstream newspaper articles, and a plethora of archival materials including neighborhood studies, feminist organization meeting minutes and pamphlets, position papers, flyers, and more. The thesis argues that the largely white self-defined feminism that emerged and grew up in Baltimore, in this neighborhood in the northeastern part of the city, through its interactions with others and with place, became a staunchly antiracist socialist feminism that did not insist on gender as the primary oppression and instead incorporated gender, race, and sexuality into its anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist analysis. Through their involvement with antiwar and black liberation organizing in Baltimore and elsewhere, the feminists cultivated an increasingly militant political analysis that came to view gender, racial, sexual, and economic struggles as inextricably linked. The feminists rooted themselves and enacted their politics in this mixed-income and mixed-race neighborhood in Baltimore during a period of economic decline, instead of fleeing to the suburbs like much of the city's white population. Further, they recognized the tendency of white leftist organizations to create insular communities of privilege sheltered from an oppressive society, and so created accessible institutions and ideologically sound organizing bodies that worked to embody their politics but also to serve the community. In this neighborhood, these institutions and projects included a the first nationally distributed second-wave feminist journal, Women: A Journal of Liberation , the People's Free Medical Clinic, a couple of food co-ops, a Lesbian Community Center, Bread an Roses Coffee House, the women's 31st Street Bookstore, a daycare called Red Wagon Child Center, and more. These prefigurative institutions were seen as only a part of a greater societal transformation, but served to help people survive in the meantime. ```Working on Many Levels''' recounts how these feminists formulated (and reformulated) a politics that refused universality and equality, and instead embraced difference and proponed justice, responding to issues that came up throughout the course of their organizational life.},

  shorttitle = {``{{Tramping}} for Justice''},
  abstract = {In May 1954 the United States Supreme Court ruled that segregation in education was unconstitutional. Schools were given one year to desegregate. The Baltimore City School Board, however, ordered immediate compliance, effective the following fall. There was hesitation on the part of some in the larger community, defiance on the part of others, but the school year would proceed largely without incident. In many ways, the relative ease of the transition can be traced to the twelve years immediately prior to Brown and to the watershed event of the April 1942 March on Annapolis. During that elapse of time, the wall of Jim Crow was in effect, dismantled\textemdash{}taken down brick by brick. Victories against compulsory race segregation, ``Jim Crow'' segregation, in other areas prepared Baltimore for its inevitable demise in education.
Recently, historians have worked to broaden perceptions of the underlying continuities of African American struggle for civil rights. Much of this revision has involved the aspect of time, placing the so-called Modern Civil Rights Movement (1954\textendash{}1965) within broader chronological contexts. While the aspect of time will likely continue to be revisited, another possible avenue for revision that has yet to receive necessary attention, is the movement's comprehensiveness\textemdash{}its spaces. As important perhaps as issues of chronology is the breadth of concurrent contests over the various social spaces\textemdash{}residential, public, educational, and employment, for example.
Through an examination of Baltimore during the period 1942\textendash{}1954, this study will demonstrate that what may be termed in the singular as ``the'' struggle was in actuality many battles being waged simultaneously in multiple walks of life, in the various spaces of existence, and by many of the same folk. Though subtle, indirect, and non-coordinated, the multifaceted ``attack'' on discrimination brought about a call for an end to Jim Crow segregation.
Where appropriate, this study pointedly distinguishes between Jim Crow segregation (the laws that kept blacks and whites off of the same public golf courses or public tennis courts, for example, even when they wanted to play together), and Jim Crow discrimination (the practice of hotels, department stores, and lunch counters of treating white patrons different than blacks, though not compelled to do so by law). Jim Crow segregation was compulsory. Jim Crow discrimination was undertaken voluntarily.
This study is principally concerned with the demise of Jim Crow segregation in Baltimore. This study does not, however, attempt to detail, explore, or even suggest the end of discrimination and racial inequity in that city. The dismantling of Jim Crow statutes was but an important step in the process. Though the post-1954 aspects of the process itself would retrace many of the areas covered here, non-discrimination and racial equity would not be achieved for several decades following Brown. Many would argue that it has yet to be achieved.},

During the first half of the 1960s, the United States experienced a rights revolution. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 provided substantial legislative advances for African Americans; meanwhile, the United States Supreme Court took the role of social activist in cases like Griswold v. Connecticut. However, urban violence and black militancy helped foster a backlash against the rights revolution. Mahoney capitalized on the growing backlash, using his opposition to open housing to garner the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. While he gained the nomination, Mahoney effectively split the Democratic Party for the general election. Many Maryland Democrats found themselves alienated by Mahoney's stand; so much so, they rushed to support the Republican nominee, Spiro T. Agnew. While Mahoney lost the general election, his position on open housing exemplified the growing polarization within the United States during the 1960s. Furthermore, Mahoney's stand highlighted a growing political rift that existed in the Democratic Party, which provided the basis for Richard M. Nixon's southern strategy.},

  abstract = {During the Kennedy Administration, several African dignitaries were victims of discrimination along the Maryland portion of U.S. Route 40. Causing tension both in the Civil Rights Movement and the Cold War, this discrimination prompted the federal government to create the Special Protocol Service Section, which dealt with the incidents and tried to come up with solutions to the problem. The incidents prompted the SPSS, led by Pedro Sanjuan, to heavily support a public accommodations law that would outlaw discrimination in any of Maryland's public accommodations, which included motels, hotels, and restaurants. Such federal intervention into a state and local matter caused conflict between Marylanders and members of the State Department. Press and propaganda also played an important role in the Route 40 ordeal. Soviet propaganda used the discrimination to try and sway new African countries to the Russian side of the Cold War.
By examining primary sources, including State Department documents and Baltimore area newspapers, this thesis looked at the aspects of the Route 40 discrimination. Drawing most of the primary sources from the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, the thesis provides a unique perspective on how the government dealt with the entire issue of the Route 40 discrimination.
This thesis shows how the incidents on Route 40 thrust Maryland into the national and international scene by examining the incidents themselves, the government's response and how these played in both the domestic and international press.},

Sources include committee reports, correspondence, newspaper articles, photographs, oral interviews, books, and essays.
Research revealed that many cities across the country responded similarly to King's death; however, it was not his death alone that caused the rebellion. In addition, there was no homogenous viewpoint among any one group of people regarding the uprising. The rebellion did not directly have a visible positive impact as many of the problems with race relations, housing, crime and education in Baltimore that budded in the 1960s increased in the years following the civil disturbance.},

The small number of white workers, moreover, had given the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees (Local 1199) a chilly reception because of the union's racial rhetoric. To attract white workers, union management soft pedaled the racial rhetoric that had characterized unionizing campaigns of earlier years. The conflation of civil rights and traditional union issues enabled Local 1199 to make gains at the hospital in 1969. When the union abandoned its racial rhetoric it attracted more white workers but rendered itself less influential and less effective.},

  shorttitle = {Infectious Fear},
  abstract = {The title of this dissertation, ``Infectious Fear,'' derives from its central thesis: that in the post-Reconstruction South, the politics of race served to inform certain aspects of public health policy as much, if not more, as did actual medical knowledge of certain diseases, namely tuberculosis. That the disease was caused by an identifiable bacillus was common knowledge among physicians after the mid-1880s. That poor housing, inadequate diet, lack of education, and overwork (all suffered by urban African Americans) played as much a role in the development of the disease as casual encounters with the bacillus was also known by the turn of the century. Nonetheless, it was larger political attitudes towards African Americans that shaped public health policy as it related to them.
The first part of the dissertation is largely devoted to turn-of-the-century urban politics and racial theory, considering the political economy of American cities, especially in the South, and its role in the production of disparities between black and white tuberculosis mortality. On the other hand, much of the racial theory used to explain this disparity was formed outside of American cities, in the context of European or American empire, or by apologists of rural agricultural slavery. From racialist premises established in the nineteenth century (acclimatization theory, racial predisposition, etc.), physicians and theorists made claims that purported to have relevance for American cities in the twentieth century.
The rest of the dissertation is devoted to African-American tuberculosis as it was experienced and perceived by black sufferers and white and black physicians. In this regard, I explore the multiple modalities in which black tuberculosis was represented\textemdash{}in urban cartography, social photography, progressive politics. I also show how the experience of black tuberculosis always occurred within social constraints. In that regard, I argue that an exploration of black tuberculosis is incomplete if it focuses only on immediate victims of the disease. Family members, especially the children of the afflicted, also suffered the disease in ways that were unique, individual, and personal, yet formed by discernible patterns of inequality.},

  abstract = {After 1830, the city of Baltimore contained the largest free African American population of any city, and this trend continued until the Civil War. At the same time, the enslaved population of Baltimore steadily declined after 1820, a phenomenon not experienced in any city below the Mason-Dixon line. The growth of the free black population in Baltimore was fueled largely by in-migration of black women, and although slavery was on the decline, female numbers decreased at a much slower rate than did enslaved males. From 1820 onwards, women comprised the majority of the African Americans in Baltimore; by 1860 women constituted 60 percent of the free and 70 percent of the enslaved black population.
While numerous free black community studies have examined the lives of this anomalous group whose experiences called into the question the meaning of American liberty, the tendency has been to universalize the free black experience as male. Women's central roles and crucial efforts on behalf of black communities have been slighted or ignored altogether. Thus, a consideration of women in the country's largest urban free black community seems an ideal opportunity to explore fully the lives of these women and their role in both the creation and maintenance of community in the antebellum era. This dissertation studies in-depth the various aspects that shaped\textemdash{}and were shaped by\textemdash{}black women in antebellum Baltimore. While the focus is on free black women, a consideration of the lives of enslaved women is not overlooked. Black women's distinct experiences in the family, forced and paid-labor outside of the home, religion, and resistance are explored. The commitment of black women to improving their own lives as well as those of their community were vital to any and all successes that blacks could claim in antebellum Baltimore.},

  shorttitle = {From Humble Beginnings to a Profound Impact},
  abstract = {The first Methodist Episcopal Church (ME Church) of Baltimore, Maryland was founded in 1772 by Reverend Joseph Pilmoor, an English missionary and disciple of the founder of Methodism, John Wesley. Pilmoor was sent to America from England by Wesley in 1769, to teach the Methodist faith. He landed in Philadelphia and made his way to Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina, preaching the Methodist religion. While preaching in Baltimore, he was granted use of Otterbein Chapel also known as the Old Dutch Church. The people of Baltimore responded favorably to Methodism, so that in 1774 the Lovely Lane Meeting House was constructed at Redwood and South streets. In 1784, this became the site of the Christmas Conference which organized the American Methodist Episcopal Church. The church moved several times from the Redwood and South Streets location to Light Street (two locations), Charles and Fayette Streets and was known as First Methodist Episcopal Church. Outpost churches known as The Baltimore City Station were established divided by race. The ``Colored Methodist Society'' was initiated in 1785. ``The Colored Methodist Society'' produced two of the oldest African American Methodist Churches in the country, Sharp Street Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church (1797) and Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church (1815).
The present location of Lovely Lane United Methodist Church is at 2200 North Calvert Street. It was erected as a centennial memorial of the 1784 Christmas Conference. In 1954, it assumed the name of Lovely Lane United Methodist Church after being named First Methodist Church for a number of years. It is known as the ``Mother Church'' of American Methodism. The Church currently serves as a place of worship for approximately two hundred members. It is also the home of the Methodist Historical Society and houses an active museum and archive. Additionally, it has initiated several institutions of higher education which include the Centenary Biblical Institute, now known as Morgan State University (MSU), which was established in 1867. MSU was the first institution of higher education for African Americans in Baltimore, Maryland and for the first seventy-two years it was partially funded and fully managed by Lovely Lane Methodist Church. Morgan State University is still in existence today and has conferred thousand of degrees since its inception in 1867.
The purpose of this thesis is to examine the role that Lovely Lane United Methodist Church had in ``birthing'' the African American Methodist Community of Baltimore, Maryland, and its surrounding environs. The time period examined in this thesis includes the founding of Methodism in America in 1772, the establishment of First Methodist Church (Lovely Lane) from its beginning in 1774, founding of the ``Colored Methodist Society'' in 1784, Sharp Street Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church in 1797, Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1816, and the Centenary Bible Institute (Morgan College) 1867.},

Beginning in the 1800s Blacks in Baltimore organized to establish viable entities. One of which was Provident Hospital. It was the first and only African American owned and operated medical facility in Maryland. It provided the impetus for other African Americans businesses and institutions. Its iconic presence united African Americans to collectively stand against Baltimore's segregationist community.
This thesis chronicles the accomplishment and failures of the first African American established institutions, businesses, and organizations in the Eleventh Ward of Baltimore. African Americans of the Eleventh Ward did not acquiesce to segregation, and they did not allow racism to prevent them from obtaining jobs, education, and decent housing. Blacks of the Eleventh Ward continually fought for equality.},

  abstract = {This study examines the migration of fifteen African American women who came to Baltimore City from the rural South between 1918 and 1946. These dates represent the time period when the women moved to Baltimore. Moreover, the period is significant because it includes the era of World War I and The Great Migration, The Great Depression and World War II. These major events led to major economic and socio-political changes in the lives of African Americans.
Most scholarship on migration overlooks the experiences of African American women, especially the effects of race, class, and gender on the women's struggle to establish their place in society. Using Baltimore as a case study, this research examines the significance of work, which was a major economic factor in their migration. The investigation also focuses on how the socio-political issues associated with education, suffrage, segregation, and discrimination affected the lives of migrant women in the city, and finally looks at class and its importance in the women's social relationships. The oral testimonies of the fifteen migrant women who moved to Baltimore during the years under consideration give voice to their experiences in relation to these factors.
The data are organized into six chapters. Chapter one is a description of the objectives of the study, methodology, problems associated with the research, profiles of the women, and a review of the literature. This chapter also focuses on sources pertinent to Black migration, raises questions about how migration influenced the lives of African American women, how gender proscriptions controlled their work, and how work and class influenced the women's social relationships within the Black community in Baltimore. Chapter two focuses on the reasons why women migrated to Baltimore rather than to cities; emphasizing the economic, political and social climate in the South as contributing factors. The analysis also includes an overview of the city's history, the impact of race on work opportunities, and the effects of the two world wars and the Depression on African Americans in Baltimore. Chapter three is an analysis of these and additional social and political factors in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. These cities were selected because they were magnets for large numbers of migrant African American women from the South. The analysis in chapter four provides a perspective of the times in terms of the economic and socio-political conditions that existed when the women arrived in Baltimore. Chapter V is an analysis of how class and status created social distance, though not class conflict, among the women. Chapter VI contains my conclusions.
The women in the study moved to Baltimore with their parents, with relatives, or alone, from farms and rural towns in Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Problems associated with race, class, and gender, continued to plague the women after they moved to Baltimore. This was especially true of the kinds of jobs available to them. And even though they found that segregation and discrimination dictated their place in the city's economic and socio-political culture, they chose to remain in the city, believing that conditions could be no worse than the life they had left behind in the rural South.},

  abstract = {Since a quality education was believed to be a gateway to a productive future, members of Baltimore City's African American community sparred continuously with school officials for equal access to educational facilities and opportunities throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. From 1920 to 1921, George D. Strayer surveyed the Baltimore City Public School. His report documented, in detail, the deplorable school conditions for African American educators and students. Importantly, the recommendations of the school survey led to monumental changes within the Baltimore City Division of Colored Schools between 1923 and 1943. This thesis analyzes school reform efforts from an educational reformist`s perspective and its impact on providing a quality, albeit still segregated education for African Americans living in Baltimore City until World War II. This thesis, which relies on the Strayer Report, The Baltimore Afro-American and The Baltimore Sun newspapers, and official school reports for primary sources, demonstrates how school reform efforts provided African American educators with the necessary tools to improve the quality of education for African American students in the Baltimore City School System during legal segregation.},

  abstract = {This is a study of the involvement of Maryland women in politics from the 1890s to 1930. It builds on previous studies to support an expanded conceptualization of politics.
Elite white activists in the late nineteenth century, building on their concern for the home, extended their interests as wives and mothers to their interests as citizens, and both reflected and shaped the rising Progressive movement in Maryland. They formed local and then statewide organizations, and they worked to replace traditional politics with activist, efficient, and expanded government. As they brought their concerns to the public agenda, they created an increased public role for themselves, choosing at the same time to work cooperatively with male leaders. Black women activists were reformers in their communities as well, and while for the most part segregated from white women's organizations, created and participated in cooperative ventures with white women.
The suffrage movement in Maryland grew out of this activism and also extended it. White suffragists differed over strategy and tactics, but they maintained unity in an agenda that combined social goals with the advancement of women. World War I offered white women activists, already part of a statewide network, the opportunity to assume a greatly expanded role in the burgeoning wartime government. During the war, black women activists expanded their influence as well, but they also expanded and their independence from white women's organizations.
After the adoption of women's suffrage in 1920, white women activists continued to pursue an agenda that combined social reform and women's advancement. Black women remained apart as they formed the base for the civil rights movement of a later day. White activists, meanwhile, continuing their practice of cooperation, established a conscious partnership with political parties and local and state governments, and tailored their agenda to conform to their perception of political reality. While their continuing cooperation resulted in losses as well as gains, this study supports others that have concluded that the activism of white women resulted in a new politics of interdependence, with an expanded citizenry and an expanded social consciousness.},

  abstract = {In 1897, John H. Murphy, Sr. purchased the equipment and naming rights for the Afro-American newspaper in Baltimore, Maryland, for \$200. Since that time, the Afro has served as a voice for the Black community, local, nationally and abroad and has been owned and operated by descendants of Murphy; establishing it as the oldest African American family owned publication in the country. The story that is not widely known is that John H. Murphy, Sr. received the money to acquire the paper from his wife, Martha Murphy. Family, Faith and Feminism: The Murphy Women, 1896\textendash{}2000 focuses on Martha and four other women within the family who have not received the same recognition as their male counterparts for their contributions to society.
Subsequently, this dissertation explores the impact of racism, sexism and classism on the social activism of the female members of the Murphy family, their participation in women's organizations, role in the newspaper business, and involvement in religious work. Utilizing a Black feminist lens, an analysis was conducted on the duel effects of race and gender by framing how women within the family attempted to resist systematic oppressive behaviors by defying traditional gender roles and combating racist elements imposed by the dominant hegemonic forces.
Recognizing that the Murphy family is deeply rooted in the historiography of Black Baltimore, research was narrowed to focus on five specific women for this study: Martha Murphy, the wife of John H. Murphy, Sr.; Francis Louise Murphy, who established the Afro Clean Block Campaign; Vashti Turley Murphy, a founder of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated; Sister Constance Murphy, an Anglican nun; and Vashti Murphy McKenzie, the first elected female bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Their activism and everyday life experiences were placed within a historical context of the social conditions and circumstances present during certain political shifts such as the women's suffrage, clubwomen's and feminist movements which demonstrate how the intersection of race, class and gender specifically influenced the Murphy women's involvement in uplift activities, breaking down barriers within religious institutions, and civil rights.},

  abstract = {Since the 1960s, white working-class politics has been explained in terms of backlash: because of black civil rights gains, once "liberal" voters became conservative and abandoned the Democratic Party. But there was more continuity than change in postwar blue-collar political consciousness. Working whites were New Deal liberals only in the most limited sense: they valued New Deal promises of blue-collar economic security but suspected broader goals of social equality. This study of white working-class institutions, electoral politics, and community protest finds that blue-collar allegiance to the Democratic Party stemmed from a distinctive white working-class political consciousness rooted in the community rather than the workplace. This political consciousness emphasized community obligations and responsibilities over rights, although rights became increasingly important.
In 1940s Baltimore, Democratic politicians upheld blue-collar institutions--industrial employment and white neighborhoods--while leaving racial exclusion unchallenged. Blue-collar anticommunism, shaped by local experience, redirected populist attacks away from business elites toward political and intellectual liberals. When, in the 1950s, residential and school desegregation grew threatening, working whites expressed their discontent in racial terms. This political language of "white rights" was, however, both indefensible and inaccurate. During the 1960s, as crime rates rose and public institutions increasingly seemed responsive to minorities and indifferent toward working whites, blue-collar discontent focused more on liberal elites who fostered social change than on blacks. Working whites' political consciousness remained rooted in the white community, but their political language now emphasized populist claims to the rights of "working" people--claims difficult to discredit on racist grounds.
Most blue-collar Baltimore voters remained loyal to the Democratic party up to 1980, not because it was the party of liberalism but because they considered it the party of the blue-collar city. This vision likely weakened thereafter, but white working-class convictions regarding the value of majoritarian democracy and the inherent limits of political solutions remained to reshape the politics of the 1980s and 1990s.},

  shorttitle = {Living Just Enough in the City},
  abstract = {Using the historical case study of Baltimore, Living Just Enough in the City focuses on the dynamism of public housing communities--the people, their activism, and the places (both low-rise and high-rise)--between 1940 and 1980. The dissertation analyzes the social experiences and grassroots activism of tenants, particularly African American women and men, as a way to unveil the changing landscapes of public housing and to explore how urban policy shaped black working people's lives. Public housing was an integral part of the black working-class experience and became a critical policy tool for rehousing--and (re)segregating--black people already concentrated in and increasingly migrating to inner cities in post-1940 America.
Living Just Enough in the City is simultaneously a documentation of and an exploration into the spirit and nature of black working class activism. Tenants' concerns and responses reflected their desire to address daily and/or practical needs as well as transcend their marginal status within a raced, gendered and classed hierarchy. An examination of tenants' lives and their activism on the local level shows that people struggled wherever they were, and that their struggles, which varied in content and form over time, were often a part, through not necessarily simply a reflection of, larger social movements. The focus on tenant activism, therefore, also provides a lens into broader historical events such as workers' unrest during the 1940s, civil rights struggles beginning in the 1940s and 1960s, and black power movements in the 1960s. Living Just Enough in the City, then, offers a unique perspective into the changes in and nature and limits of public housing; documents the agency of a group of people who have often been ignored or viewed as passive; and contributes to the literature on urban history, working-class activism, women's studies, social movements, social policy, and race, gender and class.},

  abstract = {In 1930, the Black freedom movement and the workers' movement were at low ebb in the Baltimore metropolitan area. Ten years later, both movements had grown to embrace thousands and had made impressive gains. This dissertation studies these two movements as they developed during the 1930s, the overlapping communities from which they emerged, the variety of organizational forms and activities they generated, and the ways they interrelated with each other.
The development of these two movements occurred in three phases. During the first phase, 1930-1934, both movements were strongly local in character. Key to this period were: the City-Wide Young People's Forum (the Forum), a local organization of African American youth; the racially-integrated People's Unemployment League (PUL), by 1934 one of the largest unemployed organizations in the country; and several initiatives of the Baltimore Communist Party.
During the second phase, 1934-1935, the processes of the earlier period culminated in several important events, including the "Baltimore Soviet," when Communist-led seamen took control of the relief and hiring systems on the docks; the growing cooperation between the Black youth leadership of Forum and the white leadership of the PUL, climaxing in the Socialist Party campaign of 1934; a major legal victory over Jim Crow with Murray v. University of Maryland. Underlying these events was a tendency toward convergence between segments of the two movements locally, and increasing pressure for each movement to merge into its growing national counterpart.
During the third phase, 1935-1940, both Baltimore movements reoriented in essentially national directions. The local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was reorganized and, by the early 1940s, was the second largest in the country. And the unions of the Committee for Industrial Organizations began their march through Baltimore's industry. While the workers' and Black freedom movements developed in parallel rather than convergent directions during this period, important areas of cooperation existed, laying foundations for greater joint work during the war years.
This dissertation draws a variety of archival records, newspapers and pamphlets, and secondary sources; oral history is especially important.},

  abstract = {Historians who have studied the American state have focussed primarily on Washington, D.C., particularly for the period beginning with the New Deal. First, they examined the role of Franklin Roosevelt in New Deal politics. Subsequently, they argued that New Deal policymaking combined the associative state developed in the 1920s with a more elaborate, though incomplete, welfare state. Recent historians have concentrated on the role of federal officials who developed and elaborated policy--"political entrepreneurs" who sold public policies as ways to solve specific social problems while building their own organizations. What has been largely ignored in this analysis is the manner in which officials actually implemented programs, and localities shaped policy in the process. This study of public housing examines how Federal policies were reforged in "local deals," a process that was one of the major characteristics of the New Deal and its aftermath.
In arenas that took a variety of forms, policy implementation in America involved a complex process of community politics and Federal-community negotiations, with local structures shaping the process and the outcome. In the case of public housing policy, municipal political organization, local political culture, the vernacular housing stock, and the urban economy shaped local policy contests. Politicians, businesses, civic groups, neighborhoods and households connected with the public housing program in different ways. Each developed a distinctive strategy to promote, contest, use, or subvert it. It was in the resulting negotiations and interactions that public housing flourished, died, or was cast.
Meanwhile, the program in turn reshaped local political arrangements. New groups mobilized to support the program or pose policy alternatives. Old players developed new tactics. While some grew alarmed at the increasing federal presence, antistatism inexorably gave way to a process in which the federal programs became permanent, and the politics became intergovernmental. Political actors adapted. They thus defined the new program, and then engaged it in a manner that made policymaking continual and inclusive of nearly every aspect of the public housing program as a variety of critical problems emerged.},

  abstract = {Through the extensive use of church records, this thesis explores the leadership of Black women in the establishment of a Baltimore Christian church. A Black feminist paradigm is used to interpret the history of this institution because the paradigm encompasses the ethnic history of African Americans as well as the issue of gender equality within the Black community. The paradigm asserts that males as well as females can be feminists, and that Black men are historically sensitive to the struggles of women for gender equality. Thus the early history of Douglas Memorial Community Church, as a congregation founded by a woman and led by a pastor who recognized the ministerial gifts of women, is well suited for this paradigm.
Founded in 1925 by Mary E. Jones, the church was originally named Cosmopolitan African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church. Jones, who was president of the Trustee Aid Society of the Bethel AME Church, scheduled a meeting with Bethel dissidents, and requested that Rev. Frederick Douglas serve as pastor. In 1938, the church was renamed Douglas Memorial Community Church.
My thesis will explore the contributions of women to the founding and organization of the congregation during the Douglas pastorate, 1925\textendash{}48. I argue that women were tremendously empowered under Douglas' pastorate. He penned the Black Community Church movement creed that woman could serve as pastors. This doctrinal statement was quite radical since traditionally the office of pastor is reserved for men.},

Through use of primary sources, including oral histories and interviews of Black Panther women, this thesis provides evidence which not only dismantles the false claims of the Black Panthers as a criminal hate group, but also disproves the validity of the BPP's hypermasculine image.},

  abstract = {The contributions of African-American performers to music making in the United States are usually conceived in terms of various popular styles such as jazz, spirituals and gospel music. The present study will demonstrate that their contribution, even in the days of segregation, was still more wide-ranging, encompassing Western art music as well. As proof of this thesis, this study will document the activities of the Baltimore City Colored Orchestra and City Colored Chorus. It focuses on the involvement of African Americans in the 1930s as a segregated group in the United States in the area of classical performance.
The orchestra was established in 1929, and the chorus two years later. Both organizations were sponsored by the Baltimore City Municipal Department. They were the only minority municipally sponsored orchestra and chorus in the United States during the 1930s.
This research reconstructs the experiences and reactions of the white and black communities toward the orchestra and chorus. The details of the organizations' development are presented, along with narrative descriptions of the concerts, radio broadcasts, repertory and critics' reviews. Biographical information concerning the conductors, soloists and other pertinent persons is supplied. The study also reviews other cultural activities in the African-American community: the youth symphony, school performances, and church musical activities. The involvement of the Federation of Musicians Union is also discussed.
The purposes of the Baltimore City Colored Orchestra and City Colored Chorus were to create and educate appreciative audiences of all ages through their exposure to classical concerts, to develop the performance capabilities of the musicians by learning and playing the classical repertoire, and to feature new talent.
This study will supply some information regarding African Americans in American music history. Hence, the existence of the orchestra and chorus is a means of understanding some of the positive and negative influences on Baltimore's African American community and its musical heritage.},

The Bank's method of disseminating interest and extra dividends rewarded black savers with large accounts that left their monies in the bank over long periods of time. Many black families came together, using a form of communal or collective capitalism, to make large deposits, benefiting from the policy. Although, other factors determined the success of savers utilizing this policy, such as occupation, self-discipline, and family structure, this policy allowed black people at different income levels to circumvent some of the socio-economic factors that limited wealth and security for individuals.

White Baltimoreans adhered to a complex and dense mass of ideas and images based on the assumption of black inferiority. My work combines two strands of historiography that are generally treated separately. I compliment African American historiography and studies of white racial ideas by treating both in a local study. I find a vast gulf between white Baltimorean's imagery of African Americans and the way that the free black population of the city conducted their lives. White Baltimoreans perceived free blacks as a despicable group whose natural condition was enslavement. They imagined free black people as promiscuous, irresponsible, undisciplined, and incapable of any but the most fleeting emotional ties. Baltimore whites did not see that the city's free blacks contradicted degrading ideas projected upon them by overcoming difficult conditions to live autonomously from whites in a lawful, dignified, and responsible manner.

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the African American community of Baltimore, Maryland, during the seventy years prior to the Civil War, with special comparisons to black populations of Charleston and Philadelphia during the same period. This study traces the social transformation of the city's black population from a transient aggregate of migrant freedpeople, fresh from slavery, to a cohesive community, relatively unwracked by class and intra-racial divisions, inclusive of slaves as well as free Negroes, with strong churches, and boasting the establishment of such exclusively black organizations and associations as fraternal orders, literary associations, and debating societies.
While other urban African American communities founded similar social organizations, each suffered from internal class divisions which caused most of their social institutions to be founded by--and reserved for--the community elite. Baltimore's black community did not depend upon wealth, or its wealthy leadership, for strength; its vitality derived from and depended upon the concord of its entire populace--a populace which was overwhelmingly economically poor. Yet this very economic deprivation allowed Baltimore's African American residents to forge a genuine community with which they not only avoided the divisions of other black urban communities, but allowed them to weather the racial tempests of the antebellum years.
Moreover, because of the unique course of manumissions in Maryland after the American Revolution, Baltimore's black residents were overwhelmingly black, rather than mulatto, and as a result the community was far less stratified by skin color than comparable lower South cities such as Charleston and New Orleans. Through this communal organization and group solidarity, Baltimore's black people had riveted together a cohesive urban community, both free and slave, which looked within for identification, yet which also exerted a centrifugal presence of solidarity that reached and affected black persons throughout the upper South. Perhaps more than any other such population, the story of Baltimore's black people exemplifies the nature of a cohesive community perhaps in its truest sense. Through this community strength, Baltimore's black community was able to resist and survive a rising tide of racial antipathy towards free Negroes which swept the nation, but which was particularly acute in Maryland.},

With this declaration of independence, the Maryland State Colonization Society embarked on a thirty year journey during which it failed miserably in its very purpose. The Maryland State Colonization Society failed to convince free African Americans to immigrate to Africa in order to pursue a life free of oppression and racism. Nevertheless, the Maryland State Colonization Society sustained an official and financial relationship with the Maryland General Assembly during this period. The thesis explores the underlying motivations and controversies which allowed the Maryland General Assembly to look to the Maryland State Colonization Society as the answer to its own sectional ``crises.'' Through the rhetoric and arguments published in the Maryland Colonization Journal, the Maryland State Colonization Society became a voice for moderation and compromise amongst the divisive and sectional viewpoints of the North and South. Providing a program which slaveholders and anti-slavery proponents could suit to their own beliefs, the white population of Maryland could believe that they had answered the ``problem'' of slavery and a growing free African American population. Through the Maryland State Colonization Society's program, the population of Maryland made a deliberate and prolonged evaluation of slavery's present and future role in the state. Consequently, this allowed the legislatures and leaders of Maryland to make the pragmatic decision to remain in the Union during the Civil War.},

  abstract = {The Oblate Sisters of Providence, co-founded by Sulpician priest James Joubert and mulatto Caribbean emigre Elizabeth Clarisse Lange in Baltimore in 1828, formed the first permanent community of African American Roman Catholic women religious in the world. During the 1830s the Oblate Sisters forged the patterns of their communal life, conducted a school for black girls, delineated their complex relationship with the black lay community, and sought acceptance as a legitimate constituency within both the antebellum Roman Catholic Church and southern society.
During the 1840s the Oblate community confronted a series of crises: the death of co-founder James Joubert, the first departures and dismissal of professed members, and apparent desertion by church authorities. For four years the Oblate Sisters persevered in their observance of religious life and the conduct of their school without benefit of official clerical sponsorship. Oblate steadfastness attracted the support of the Redemptorist priests who assumed Oblate spiritual direction in 1847.
During the 1850s the Oblate Sisters expanded their teaching mission, refined their relationship with the black lay community, and reformulated their school curriculum and prospectus to reflect their status as a tested and mature religious community.
The Oblate Sisters both challenged and responded to the attitudes of the Church and the South about race, gender, religion, and ethnicity. Embracing the religious state proved both liberating and empowering to individuals debased by the worldly social order. In renouncing the world to consecrate themselves to God, the Oblate Sisters achieved symbolic release from socially ascribed derogation based on their identities as black women. As Oblate Sisters of Providence, women of color in the antebellum South utilized their piety and spiritual fervor to defy their socially ascribed inferior status and to exercise agency in service to others.
The Oblate Sisters inculcated into their communal consciousness positive senses of themselves as black women and as committed religious. These empowering self-images prevailed for the Oblate membership over both the ambivalence toward them as black women religious plaguing the institutional Church and the disdain toward them as both black and women religious demonstrated by white southern society.},

  shorttitle = {Black Nativism},
  abstract = {This dissertation is a study of free African American politics, in the cities of Baltimore and Philadelphia, between 1817 and 1863. At the heart of this black politics were efforts to assert the right of free African Americans to citizenship in their native United States. Claims on the ambiguous notion of citizenship were important to free blacks both as a means of improving their own lives and as a way to combat slavery. The dissertation begins with the organized black protest against the founding of the American Colonization Society. The contest over the notion, advanced by the ACS, that free blacks were not truly American, or that they could not ever be citizens in the land of their birth, powerfully shaped the language and tactics of black politics. The dissertation ends with the enlistment of black troops in the Civil War, a development which powerfully shaped subsequent arguments for full black citizenship. It argues that in this period, free African Americans developed a rhetorical language of black nativism, the assertion that birth on American soil and the contribution of one's ancestors to the American nation, had won for African Americans the right to be citizens of the United States. This assertion was made even more resonant by the increasing levels of white immigration during this period; African Americans pointed to the injustice of granting to white immigrants that which was denied to native born blacks. This discourse of nativism served as a means of weaving the fight for black citizenship into the fabric of American politics. The dissertation also argues that the cities of Philadelphia and Baltimore were part of a distinctive borderland where the issues of slavery and black citizenship were particularly explosive, and where free African Americans, therefore, found themselves with significant political leverage.},

  shorttitle = {Ruffians on the Urban Border},
  abstract = {This dissertation analyzes the social history of Baltimore's politics from 1850 to 1861. It focuses on how ward-level conflicts and allegiances shaped Baltimoreans' understanding of the national political debates leading to the Civil War. Local antagonisms stemming from strikes, and racial and ethnic conflict determined allegiance to formal political parties. Local politics were inextricably linked to Baltimore's labor history, race relations, and its street life.
Conservative merchants sympathetic to the South and their allies in the recent immigrant population organized themselves under the banner of the Democratic party. This group fought a coalition of politicians, businessmen, and native-born white skilled workers who shared opposition to the Democrats. The newly created American or Know Nothing party organized these Baltimoreans first around nativism and later Unionism. Best exemplified in election rioting, these groups fought bitterly over control of municipal government and clashed in other contexts, such as work place strikes, and corporate board rooms. Their political division loosely organized more incoherent social differences between different groups of workers, workers and employers, and rival voluntary associations.
Although parties waged this struggle with intensity, partisan conflict masked nativists' and conservative merchants' united opposition to sharing power with African-Americans, unskilled immigrant labor, and women in Baltimore's economy and municipal government. While the most publicized street battles and election riots nominally involved party antagonisms, these battles and other lesser known conflicts warned blacks and immigrants that demands for political or economic power would be violently opposed. Immigrants and blacks fought each other for control of the bottom rungs of the city's economic ladder, while native-born whites turned against immigrants to keep them out of desirable occupations and the political system.
In 1850s Baltimore, comparatively privileged groups fought bitterly for municipal power. Yet Democrats and Know Nothings, excluded the majority of the city from the two main arenas of local power, government and commerce. These conflicts occurred in the context of a spirited and violent public culture. Understanding politics' social basis in cities like Baltimore will better explain the ways that urban changes influenced the national political crises of the Civil War and Reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Race is a central motif in American history but is seldom acknowledged as such because whiteness remains normative in popular conceptions of national identity, This dissertation argues that as republican ideals faded in the nineteenth century, the native-born (`white') middle-class fashioned a national identity fused with racial beliefs to distinguish themselves not just from African-Americans but from southern and eastern European immigrants that they considered racially different as well. Nations, wrote Benedict Anderson, are `imagined communities'; in the United States that national identity has always been seen through the prism of race. Slave emancipation, southern and eastern European immigration, and industrialization cast middle-class social reform and welfare movements\textemdash{}what Robert Wiebe called `the search for order'\textemdash{}in racialized terms. Based upon a community study of Baltimore, this study demonstrates that schooling in the American past has been vastly underrated as a social and cultural process in which identities were formed and contested. Not every American grows up to join a labor union, raise a family, or vote, but nearly all of them go to school as children. Before the 1890s, schools before the 1890s, schools flew no American flag, children recited no `Pledge of Allegience,' and pupils learned little about American history; yet in that decade schools were suddenly infused with the spirit of racial nationalism. While lessons in History, Geography, and Civics reinforced the supposed superiority of `the American race,' vocational training prepared working-class children for factory employment. While clashes over race and ethnicity gave the schooling system its shape, the cultural imprint of whiteness and American nationalism were broader phenomena affecting the terms of public discourse throughout the twentieth century.*

This current study tests the prevalent belief that service during the Civil War was, on the whole, a positive experience.
This study uses a sample of 290 black Civil War veterans from Maryland. Almost all bibliographical information about these veterans was culled from pension records.
The results of this dissertation do not support the contention that service during the Civil War improved the lives of black veterans after the war. Black veterans often left the service in bad physical and psychological condition and this, in turn, precluded their ability to work in jobs that required heavy manual labor. Many black veterans, therefore, were often dependent upon the charity and good will of others as well as the pension bureau. Ironically, however, the debilities from which many veterans suffered compelled them to seek help and this, in turn, helped bolster the size and complexity of Maryland's black community.},

  abstract = {The following examines the complexities of slavery in Maryland in the antebellum period and argues that as a result of Maryland's geographic location as a border between North and South, Maryland slaveholders desperately clung to the institution and attempted to shape their world into a slave society, regardless of the fact that slavery had long been dying out as an economic necessity. In the process, they called for federal protection of fugitive slave property, subscribed to a strict code of white southern conduct, and attempted to weed out any threat to slavery\textemdash{} mainly the state's large free black population. This concept is intended to argue against the idea that Maryland was a middling ground where ties to slavery were somehow weak or insignificant as a result of economic forces. As the Civil War approached, Maryland slaveholders in fact hardened the institution at the expense of Maryland's African American population.},

  abstract = {Dead for Colored People: The Creation of Mount Auburn Cemetery explores the common theme of African American history-the struggle for freedom and autonomy-via the African American cemetery. This study first focuses on how African Americans in Baltimore, MD agitated and succeeded in establishing African American burial rights. Secondly, it argues that these burial rights led to African Americans obtaining freedom and autonomy. This study is specifically situated on Mount Auburn Cemetery, located in South Baltimore, and examines the numerous social and historical factors that shaped, transformed, and ultimately led to a small African American burial ground becoming a thirty-four acre cemetery, a social institution, and a business. Starting in 1807, seven African Americans bought two and one-fourth acres of land giving African Americans, free and enslaved, a right to freedom through death. African Americans could not control their enslaved and marginalized lives, but they could control their deaths. Post emancipation, the cemetery strategized a moved to South Baltimore, bought more land, and created a symbiotic relationship with a newly formed African American community by the name of Hullsville. The cemetery professionalized and became a business paving the way for independent African American morticians.
It is important to note that this dissertation is not a narrow history of some obscure cemetery that fell into disarray. Instead, it places Mount Auburn Cemetery as a unit of analysis in order to do the following: a) illustrate the historical significance of Mount Auburn Cemetery to the African American community; b) study nineteenth century and twentieth century race relations between Blacks and Whites, especially the relationship involved within the origins of the cemetery; c) understand the significance of African American cultural norms and the interconnectedness of death and funerary practices within the Black community.},

Masjid Al Haqq, which was previously called Mosque Six, has been a mainstay for African Americans seeking Islamic guidance in Baltimore City since 1956. The Mosque and its members had significant impact on economic, social, and political activities in Baltimore City. Adopting a narrative approach; this research investigates the ideological, economical, educational, political, and social activities of the Mosque and its members from 1956 to 1996.
This thesis states that the change in ideology when the Mosque transitioned from Mosque Six to Masjid Al Haqq after the death of Elijah Muhammad significantly changed the daily operations of the Mosque. Warith Deen Muhammad, who took over the leadership of the NOI in 1975 after the death of Elijah Muhammad, wanted to change the direction of the NOI toward Orthodox Islam while some NOI members wanted to continue the teachings of Elijah Muhammad resulting in a split in the movement. The economical, educational, political, and social activities of the Mosque and its members were dictated by the Islamic doctrine adhered to by the national leader of the Islamic movement. Mosque members in the 1950s to 1970s were guided by the doctrines of Nation of Islam (NOI) while in the 1980s they were guided by the doctrines of the World Community of Al-Islam in the West (WCIW) under the leadership of Warith Deen Muhammad.},

This dissertation examines the Progressive Era from the bottom up. Far from being quiescent subjects of reform, working people built the foundations for equality between 1877 and 1920. Their efforts complicate our understandings of an era too often depicted solely as the triumph of middle-class and elite conceptions of order. Using court records, memoirs, vice reports, newspapers, and government documents this project examines the multiple ways in which Baltimore's disenfranchised residents challenged entrenched powers, altered political debates, helped establish policies on vice, and reshaped the city's residential landscape. In so doing, it uncovers a largely neglected history of African-American reformers who laid the foundation for the twentieth century civil rights movement and defeated the nation's first housing segregation ordinance. Similarly, it documents how workers and other non-elites mounted campaigns to end political corruption and economic exploitation, and how women from all of these groups addressed a range of urban woes.},

In April of that year, disturbances broke the urban landscape along lines of race and class.This book offers chapters on events leading up to the turmoil, the riots, and the aftermath as well as four rigorously edited and annotated oral histories of members of the Baltimore community. The combination of new scholarship and first-person accounts provides a comprehensive case study of this period of civil unrest four decades later.This engaging, broad-based public history lays bare the diverse experiences of 1968 and their effects, emphasizing the role of specific human actions. By reflecting on the stories and analysis presented in this anthology, readers may feel empowered to pursue informed, responsible civic action of their own.Baltimore '68 is the book component of a larger public history project, "Baltimore '68 Riots: Riots and Rebirth." The project's companion website (http://archives.ubalt.edu/bsr/index.html ) offers many more oral histories plus photos, art, and links to archival sources. The book and the website together make up an invaluable teaching resource on cities, social unrest, and racial politics in the 1960s.

  abstract = {The antebellum Free Black population represented a marginal segment of Southern society\textemdash{}a gray area in a Black and White caste structure. Nowhere was this unique status more evident than in the cities of the upper South such as Baltimore, as manumitted slaves were increasingly drawn to the opportunities provided by the urban environment. During the early decades of the nineteenth century, Baltimore's Free Black population increased dramatically, outpacing nearly every other group. In the final antebellum decade, however, this growth was virtually halted. The combination of economic recession, labor competition from the increasing immigrant population, and growing social tensions created an environment of significant change for Free Blacks. While much scholarly attention has been devoted to various aspects of this community's growth, little has focused on its changing distribution throughout the city during this crisis. The specific purpose of this study is to provide insight into the role of occupation as a catalyst for the residential change in the Free Black population of Baltimore during the 1850s. The changing distributions of the Free Black population are shown at three scales in 1850 and 1860: ward level aggregates, a citywide sample of households, and neighborhood case studies. This methodology matches the spatial data of city directories to the demographic data of the manuscript census and provides a reliable basis for pinpointing a sample of households. The block-level analysis displays the various processes of micro-scale residential turnover which resulted from occupational competition between Free Blacks and immigrants. Factors such as occupational diversity and social support networks are identified as particularly important determinants in the success of small Free Black communities to withstand such residential competition. On a citywide scale, the samples exhibit clusters of racial segregation which resulted from these processes, both within and between city wards. Overall, the resulting patterns suggest a significant shift of the Free Black population from the southeastern waterfront regions, where water and construction trades were in decline, to new emerging cores in the northeastern interior dominated by service and transportation occupations.},

  abstract = {The Age of Revolution produced a distinct paradox between the ideology of individual liberty and the existence of chattel slavery in the American south. In no instance is this paradox of freedom for some and continued oppression for others more present than in the experiences of slaves in Maryland. Slavery in the United States was not abolished following the American Revolution. Rather, the institution of chattel bondage was re-edified in local and national laws. Revolutionary thought, Christian anti-slavery theology and changing labor demands, however, did make it possible for some slaves to gain freedom through legalized manumission.
Concentrating on the themes of family, freedom and power, this study draws heavily from arguments about the American Revolution, experiences in slavery, the black family, and the simultaneous development of slavery and freedom in Maryland from 1770 to 1840. This work is a detailed treatment of slaves and their evolution into freed persons from the American Revolution into the antebellum period. Often the simultaneous rise of a free black population in the early national period eclipsed detailed discussions of slave life in Maryland. This study places the slave experience at the forefront, acknowledging that, despite the growth of a significant free black community, Maryland remained a slave society.},

It concludes with some implications for mission and ministry in the Black Community in the twentieth and twenty-first century.
John R. Slattery (1851-1926) was an Irish-American Catholic member of the Mill Hill Fathers of England. Committed to belief in the missionary nature of the church, the "universal brotherhood of all men" and the universal salvific will of God, he labored for the moral "uplift," conversion, and salvation of Black Americans and for their inclusion in the socio-political arena of society which in his view was responsible for the preservation of society. Towards these ends Slattery established several institutions to train missionaries, including Black priests and catechists, whom he saw as essential to any effective and integral mission and ministry in the Black Community.
A natural born leader filled with energy and practical creativity, Slattery was the second American Mill Hill Provincial (1878-1883); founder and first rector of St. Joseph's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland (1888) and founder of the Epiphany Apostolic College in Baltimore, Maryland (1889) and the St. Joseph's Catechetical College for Negro Catechists in Montgomery, Alabama (1900). James Gibbons, the Cardinal Archbishop of Baltimore appointed Slattery to be the superior of the Society of St. Joseph (1892-1893) which separated from Mill Hill in 1892.
Slattery was influenced and inspired by both Black and Catholic leaders of the nineteenth century among them the delegates of the five Colored Catholic Congresses inaugurated and convened between 1889 and 1894 by Daniel Rudd, a Black Catholic layman. Booker T. Washington, Cardinal Vaughan, Isaac Hecker, Cardinal Lavigerie, Archbishop John Ireland, Walter Elliot, Abbe Houtin and Loisy also played an influential role in shaping Slattery's missionary vision.

  abstract = {The study examines the apprenticeship system in Maryland during a period of 1661 to 1865 as it pertains to blacks, and as revealed by Maryland court records. Apprenticeship represented one of the earliest forms of education for blacks in Maryland. The study traces the history of apprenticeship from the Greeks and Romans, to the colony of Maryland. Differences of apprenticeship in England and the British West Indies are noted. Cases reviewed of black apprentices before the courts in England before 1800 are described and they show that no laws were established or distinctions made in court decisions based on race or class.
A description of Maryland's apprenticeship system is presented and compared with England's system. While England passed no prohibitive laws against black apprentices, Maryland's apprenticeship law of 1793 did eliminate the requirement to teach black apprentices to read and to write. Despite this prohibitive law, black apprentices continued to have contracts that contained provisions for literacy. In addition to opportunities for literacy, apprenticeship in Maryland afforded some blacks the opportunity for learning and such lucrative crafts as blacksmithing and woodworking.
Employment in these trades as journeymen sometimes led to blacks being able to buy land and retain it long enough to pass it on to the next generation. A description is also given of Maryland's topography and its influence in fostering trades. The industries of tobacco, grain, and ship building provided an array of skilled occupations for which some blacks were apprenticed. However, the availability of these occupations to black apprentices was sometimes influenced by social, political and economic factors.
By the beginning of the nineteenth century, black journeymen were able to form their own unions for some trades, contribute financially toward the building of schools and to sponsor literary societies.},

  abstract = {This study explores the origins and development of honors education at a Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Morgan State University, within the context of the Maryland higher education system. During the last decades, public and private institutions have invested in honors experiences for their high-ability students. These programs have become recruitment magnets while also raising institutional academic profiles, justifying additional campus resources. The history of higher education reveals simultaneous narratives such as the tension of post-desegregated Black colleges facing uncertain futures; and the progress of the rise and popularity of collegiate honors programs. Both accounts contribute to tracing seemingly parallel histories in higher education that speaks to the development of honors education at HBCUs. While the extant literature on honors development at Historically White Institutions (HWIs) of higher education has gradually emerged, our understanding of activity at HBCUs is spotty at best. One connection of these two phenomena is the development of honors programs at HBCUs. Using Morgan State University, I examine the role and purpose of honors education at a public HBCU through archival materials and oral histories. Major unexpected findings that constructed this historical narrative beyond its original scope were the impact of the 1935/6 Murray v Pearson, the first higher education desegregation case. Other emerging themes were Morgan's decades-long efforts to resist state control of its governance, Maryland's misuse of Morrill Act funds, and the border state's resistance to desegregation. Also, the broader histories of Black education, racism, and Black citizenship from Dred Scott and Plessy, the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation to Brown, inform this study. As themes are threaded together, Critical Race Theory provides the framework for understanding the emerging themes. In the immediate wake of the post-desegregation era, HBCUs had to address future challenges such as purpose and mission. Competing with HWIs for high-achieving Black students was one of the unanticipated consequences of the Brown decision. Often marginalized from higher education research literature, this study will broaden the research repository of honors education by documenting HBCU contributions despite a challenging landscape.},

When blacks in other Southern states lost their right to vote and participate in the political process, the Ledger encouraged readers to use their vote and their voices to speak out against the Democratic and Republican parties during an election year. As a black-owned and operated newspaper whose founders were also men of the cloth, the Ledger encouraged more black Baltimoreans to own their own businesses, self-govern themselves, and obtain respectable jobs. Many of the editorials were devoted to finding ways to uplift the black community morally, spiritually, economically, and politically.

Professional reformers and Baltimore elites presaged a trend in later residential segregation battles by allowing less affluent whites with vested interests in a neighborhood to wage the frontline attacks. At the heart of the struggle was the relationship of class and geography in the spatially unstable modern city. Middle-class whites and blacks both hoped to inscribe status onto Baltimore's residential landscape to secure their social positions and their access to municipal services. They found instead that the single-purpose neighborhoods of the modern city could abruptly change character in a way that the mixed space of preindustrial cities had not, threatening their careful investment in select urban spaces.},

  abstract = {On May 17th, 1968, a group of Catholic antiwar activists burst into a draft board in suburban Baltimore, stole hundreds of Selective Service records (which they called "death certificates"), and burned the documents in a fire fueled by homemade napalm. The bold actions of the ''Catonsville Nine'' quickly became international news and captured headlines throughout the summer and fall of 1968 when the activists, defended by radical attorney William Kunstler, were tried in federal court. In The Catonsville Nine, Shawn Francis Peters, a Catonsville native, offers the first comprehensive account of this key event in the history of 1960's protest. While thousands of supporters thronged the streets outside the courthouse, the Catonsville Nine--whose ranks included activist priests Philip and Daniel Berrigan--delivered passionate indictments of the war in Vietnam and the brutality of American foreign policy. The proceedings reached a stirring climax, as the nine activists led the entire courtroom (the judge and federal prosecutors included) in the Lord's Prayer. Peters gives readers vivid, blow-by-blow accounts of the draft raid, the trial, and the ensuing manhunt for the Berrigans, George Mische, and Mary Moylan, who went underground rather than report to prison. He also examines the impact of Daniel Berrigan's play, The Trial of the Catonsville Nine, and the larger influence of this remarkable act of civil disobedience. More than 40 years after they stormed the draft board, the Catonsville Nine are still invoked by both secular and religious opponents of militarism. Based on a wealth of sources, including archival documents, the activists' previously unreleased FBI files, and a variety of eyewitness accounts, The Catonsville Nine tells a story as relevant and instructive today as it was in 1968.},

Through the comparative lenses of these three cities, she shows why opposition erupted where it did across the United States during the same period that gave rise to public education. As common schooling emerged in the 1830s, providing white children of all classes and ethnicities with the opportunity to become full-fledged citizens, it redefined citizenship as synonymous with whiteness. This link between school and American identity, Moss argues, increased white hostility to black education at the same time that it spurred African Americans to demand public schooling as a means of securing status as full and equal members of society. Shedding new light on the efforts of black Americans to learn independently in the face of white attempts to withhold opportunity, Schooling Citizens narrates a previously untold chapter in the thorny history of America's educational inequality.},

From its beginnings as a wealthy estate owned by the Carroll Family, the land being studied here passed into the hands of the private, German-run West Baltimore Schuetzen Association, and later into the possession of the City of Baltimore as what we now know as Carroll Park. Though designed with the Olmsted vision of green space access for all, many facilities in Carroll Park remained segregated until the 1950's. Through detailing the history of the German and Segregation eras of Carroll Park, this thesis will help to contribute to the study of how Baltimore's current patterns of park access and use came to be.},

The book explores how slavery, racial discrimination, and gender shaped the goals that African American women set for themselves, their families, and their race and looks at the political tools at their disposal. By identifying key turning points for black women, the essays create a new chronology and a new paradigm for historical analysis. The chronology begins in 1837 with the interracial meeting of antislavery women in New York City and concludes with the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  The contributors focus on specific examples of women pursuing a dual ambition: to gain full civil and political rights and to improve the social conditions of African Americans. Together, the essays challenge us to rethink common generalizations that govern much of our historical thinking about the experience of African American women.  Contributors include Bettina Aptheker, Elsa Barkley Brown, Willi Coleman, Gerald R. Gill, Ann D.

One emphasizes the successes of antibiotic therapy in the 1950s and 1960s, the subsequent decline in resources for tuberculosis management, and the resurgence of tuberculosis in the 1990s. The second centres on the development of the global DOTS strategy and privileges those aspects of earlier control efforts that appear to be precursors to DOTS. Both narratives underemphasize diverse efforts by public health authorities across the world to manage the possibilities and challenges of antibiotic therapy. These efforts were shaped by local social and political contexts. The history of Baltimore's tuberculosis control programme between 1950 and 1978 illustrates the complex array of strategies public health officials employed as well as the way they adapted strategies from other jurisdictions. It highlights continuities between the pre-antibiotic and the post-antibiotic history of tuberculosis, and ways that persistent racial tropes influenced tuberculosis control programmes.},

Nevertheless, from early 1930 on the Baltimore section of the Communist Party energetically took up a steady struggle against white supremacy in its unemployment and trade union work, during its interventions in the local Black freedom movement, and in its cultural practices. Although small in size, the Baltimore party disrupted the tense social calm that had prevailed in the wake of the crash, stimulated interracial resistance to the effects of the crisis, and catalyzed a variety of new social movements that were inherently anti-racist. Contrary to prevailing historiographical wisdom, the ultra-radical third-period approach of the international communist movement was a definite asset to Baltimore communists, although the weaknesses of this approach ultimately limited their gains and legacies.},

Stapleton, Rockefeller Archive Center``A useful study . . . containing a great deal of important material on the Baltimore YMCA, its founders, the work it did for 80 years, and the benefits of that work for the community.''\textemdash{}Barry D. Karl, Harvard UniversityThis compelling story of a city and one of its key institutions affords a revealing perspective on urban modernity in the making. It challenges some of today's prevailing views on the nature and relations of America's religious institutions, as well as its public and nonprofit sectors, especially in light of recent initiatives to integrate religious groups into federally funded welfare programs.Combining urban and social history, this study of the Baltimore YMCA explores the relationships among religion, government, business, and nonprofit organizations in the development of an important industrial American city and reveals how race, masculinity, ethnicity, private institutions, and religious sensibility have influenced modern American culture.~From the 1850s to the 1930s, the Baltimore YMCA helped to shape a modern city and its approach to social welfare. Motivated by religious faith, civic need, and community service, its leaders set out to address the domestic, educational, recreational, and vocational issues most critical to the well-being of their targeted audience\textemdash{}young Christian men of (or aspiring to) the middle class. The YMCA leadership, black and white, identified and worked to correct community-wide problems in such areas as education, housing, and poverty.~Fueled by its ties to Johns Hopkins University, the Baltimore YMCA was an important incubator of people and ideas that shaped charitable activity in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Levering Hall, the campus YMCA at Hopkins, in partnership with the Charity Organization Society, nurtured the careers of men like John R. Commons, Richard T. Ely, and the Flexner brothers, greatly influencing the landscape of modern philanthropy and social welfare.Jessica I. Elfenbein is the director of the Center for Baltimore Studies and assistant professor of history at the University of Baltimore.

  abstract = {Jo Ann Argersinger's innovative analysis of the New Deal years in Baltimore establishes the significance of citizen participation and community organization in shaping the welfare programs of the Great Depression. Baltimore, a border city divided by race and openly hostile to unions, the unemployed, and working women, is a particularly valuable locus for gauging the impact of the New Deal.This book examines the interaction of federal, state, and local policies, and documents the partial efforts of the New Deal to reach out to new constituencies. By unraveling the complex connections between government intervention and citizen action, Argersinger offers new insights into the real meaning of the Roosevelt record. She demonstrates how New Deal programs both encouraged and restricted the organized efforts of groups traditionally ignored by major party politics. With federal assistance, Baltimore's blacks, women, unionizing workers, and homeless unemployed attempted to combat local conservatism and make the New Deal more responsive to their needs. Ultimately, citizen activism was as important as federal legislation in determining the contours of the New Deal in Baltimore.Originally published in 1988.A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print.

Lion in the Lobby chronicles Mitchell's life story and mission of getting the Congress to join the courts and the Executive Branch in upholding the Constitution in order to fulfill the NAACP's egalitarian philosophy. He worked with seven presidents, from Harry Truman to Jimmy Carter, to build a legacy of advocacy that won him the popular moniker of 101st senator and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1978.

  shorttitle = {Young {{Thurgood}}},
  abstract = {Thurgood Marshall was the most important American lawyer of the twentieth century. He transformed the nation's legal landscape by challenging the racial segregation that had relegated millions to second-class citizenship. He won twenty-nine of thirty-three cases before the United States Supreme Court, was a federal appeals court judge, served as the US solicitor general, and, for twenty-four years, sat on the Supreme Court. Marshall is best known for achievements after he relocated to New York in 1936 to work for the NAACP. But Marshall's personality, attitudes, priorities, and work habits had crystallized during earlier years in Maryland. This work is the first close examination of the formative period in Marshall's life. As the authorn shows, Thurgood Marshall was a fascinating man of contrasts. He fought for racial justice without becoming a racist. Simultaneously idealistic and pragmatic, Marshall was a passionate advocate, yet he maintained friendly relationships with his opponents. Young Thurgood reveals how Marshall's distinctive traits were molded by events, people, and circumstances early in his life. Professor Gibson presents fresh information about Marshall's family, youth, and education. He describes Marshall's key mentors, the special impact of his high school and college competitive debating, his struggles to establish a law practice during the Great Depression, and his first civil rights cases. The author sheds new light on the NAACP and its first lawsuits in the campaign that led to the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation decision. He also corrects some of the often-repeated stories about Marshall that are inaccurate.The only biography of Thurgood Marshall to be endorsed by Marshall's immediate family, Young Thurgood is an exhaustively researched and engagingly written work that everyone interested in law, civil rights, American history, and biography will want to read.From the Hardcover edition.},

Farrar examines how the "Afro-American" grew and prospered as a newspaper and as a business. How and why the "Afro-American" conducted its news and editorial crusades for a powerful local and national black community free of racial disabilities is discussed as well. He also evaluates whether or not the "Afro-American" succeeded or failed in its racial justice campaigns and to what extent these campaigns made a difference in the local and national black communities' struggle for racial equity. He asserts that the "Afro-American" was a black middle-class institution that wanted to shape its community according to bourgeois values, but it also broke ground by looking at class issues in the early 20th-century black community.},

Kenneth Jackson's important book revises conventional wisdom about the Klan. He shows that its roots in the 1920s can also be found in burgeoning cities among people who were frightened, dislocated, and uprooted by rapid changes in urban life. Many joined the Klan for sincere patriotic motives, unaware of the ugly prejudice that lay beneath the civic rhetoric. Mr. Jackson not only dissects the Klan's activities and membership, he also traces its impact on the public life of the twenties. In many places from Atlanta to Dallas, from Buffalo to Portland, Oregon the Klan agitated politics, held immense power, and won elective office. The Ku Klux Klan in the City is a continuing and timely reminder of the tensions and antagonisms beneath the surface of our national life.

  abstract = {Baltimore has a long, colorful history that traditionally has been focused on famous men, social elites, and patriotic events. The Baltimore Book is both a history of "the other Baltimore" and a tour guide to places in the city that are important to labor, African American, and women's history. The book grew out of a popular local bus tour conducted by public historians, the People's History Tour of Baltimore, that began in 1982. This book records and adds sites to that tour; provides maps, photographs, and contemporary documents; and includes interviews with some of the uncelebrated people whose experiences as Baltimoreans reflect more about the city than Francis Scott Key ever did.The tour begins at the B\&O Railroad Station at Camden Yards, site of the railroad strike of 1877, moves on to Hampden-Woodbury, the mid-19th century cotton textile industry's company town, and stops on the way to visit Evergreen House and to hear the narratives of ex-slaves. We travel to Old West Baltimore, the late 19th-century center of commerce and culture for the African American community; Fells Point; Sparrows Point; the suburbs; Federal Hill; and Baltimore's "renaissance" at Harborplace. Interviews with community activists, civil rights workers, Catholic Workers, and labor union organizers bring color and passion to this historical tour. Specific labor struggles, class and race relations, and the contributions of women to Baltimore's development are emphasized at each stop.

This jobs boycott movement was a crucial moment in the resuscitation of the Baltimore Black freedom movement during the early years of the Great Depression and, in fact, helped to construct the foundations of the modern Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s in that city. The Baltimore movement was also a key event in a national wave of African-American jobs boycotts-a wave that was an important, but often ignored, facet of the freedom struggle across the United States in the 1930s. In addition to telling the inner story of the Baltimore boycott movement, this article examines how this movement emerged from and transformed the local political culture of Black Baltimore; investigates the role of national forces on this movement; raises some question about the functioning of race, ethnicity, gender, and class in the context on this movement; and suggests framework to interpret Depression-era African-American jobs boycotts in other cities.},

Within a few years, however, the praise faded as it became clear that Baltimore still suffered from de facto segregation. Faced with this reality, the school board refused to take the steps necessary to remedy the problem, instead shifting the blame to society at large. This failure by the board started a pattern of abandonment by school leadership that culminated in 1991 with the privatization of several of Baltimore's public schools. The result of this abandonment is a crippled school system that still has not dealt with issues of race and equality.},

  abstract = {In A New Deal for All? Andor Skotnes examines the interrelationships between the Black freedom movement and the workers' movement in Baltimore and Maryland during the Great Depression and the early years of the Second World War. Adding to the growing body of scholarship on the long civil rights struggle, he argues that such "border state" movements helped resuscitate and transform the national freedom and labor struggles. In the wake of the Great Crash of 1929, the freedom and workers' movements had to rebuild themselves, often in new forms. In the early 1930s, deepening commitments to antiracism led Communists and Socialists in Baltimore to launch racially integrated initiatives for workers' rights, the unemployed, and social justice. An organization of radicalized African American youth, the City-Wide Young People's Forum, emerged in the Black community and became involved in mass educational, anti-lynching, and Buy Where You Can Work campaigns, often in multiracial alliances with other progressives. During the later 1930s, the movements of Baltimore merged into new and renewed national organizations, especially the CIO and the NAACP, and built mass regional struggles. While this collaboration declined after the war, Skotnes shows that the earlier cooperative efforts greatly shaped national freedom campaigns to come\textemdash{}including the civil rights movement.},

  abstract = {For most of the first half of the twentieth century, tuberculosis ranked among the top three causes of mortality among urban African Americans. Often afflicting an entire family or large segments of a neighborhood, the plague of TB was as mysterious as it was fatal. Samuel Kelton Roberts Jr. examines how individuals and institutions--black and white, public and private--responded to the challenges of tuberculosis in a segregated society. Reactionary white politicians and health officials promoted "racial hygiene" and sought to control TB through Jim Crow quarantines, Roberts explains. African Americans, in turn, protested the segregated, overcrowded housing that was the true root of the tuberculosis problem. Moderate white and black political leadership reconfigured definitions of health and citizenship, extending some rights while constraining others. Meanwhile, those who suffered with the disease--as its victims or as family and neighbors--made the daily adjustments required by the devastating effects of the "white plague."Exploring the politics of race, reform, and public health, Infectious Fear uses the tuberculosis crisis to illuminate the limits of racialized medicine and the roots of modern health disparities. Ultimately, it reveals a disturbing picture of the United States' health history while offering a vision of a more democratic future.},

For most whites, it meant the full participation of only its white citizens, based on the presumption that their black neighbors were less than equal citizens and had to be kept down. All the dramas of the Jim Crow era\textemdash{}lynching, the KKK, and disenfranchisement, but also black boycotts, petitioning for redress of grievances, lawsuits, and political activism\textemdash{}occurred in Annapolis. As they were challenging white prejudice and discrimination, tenacious black citizens advanced themselves and enriched their own world of churches, shops, clubs, and bars. It took grit for black families to survive. As they pressed on, life slowly improved\textemdash{}for some. Life in a Black Community recounts the tactics blacks used to gain equal rights, details the methods whites employed to deny or curtail their rights, and explores a range of survival and advancement strategies used by black families.},

  abstract = {Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells\textemdash{}taken without her knowledge\textemdash{}became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first ``immortal'' human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons\textemdash{}as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb's effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.  Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.  Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the ``colored'' ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta's small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia\textemdash{}a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo\textemdash{}to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.  Henrietta's family did not learn of her ``immortality'' until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family\textemdash{}past and present\textemdash{}is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.  Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family\textemdash{}especially Henrietta's daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother's cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn't her children afford health insurance?~ ~~~~~~~~~~ Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.},

Structural transformations in the postwar economy and accelerating deindustrialization contributed to high rates of unemployment in many cities in the nation's old industrial core. During the 1970s and 1980s, the urban crisis worsened. This article argues that the macroeconomic policies of Presidents Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan fueled urban decline. Responding to the waning hegemony of the United States in the global economy as well as to a domestic corporate crisis of profitability, the presidents pursued macroeconomic agendas that prioritized the revitalization of American economic dominance. Macroeconomic policy decisions in combination with white-backlash pressures constrained the range of urban policies the presidents could pursue and often compelled privatization. The federal-level decisionmaking had devastating consequences in Baltimore, Maryland, the city discussed in this article. The macroeconomic and urban policies had racialized and gendered outcomes that plunged the city into the most acute phase of the urban crisis.},

Her vision holds out the difficult promise of a truly democratic American identity whose possibilities are no longer limited and disfigured by race.From the Trade Paperback edition.},

At the same time, the history of the civil rights movement has all too often succumbed to an idolatry that stresses the centrality of prominent leaders while overlooking those who fought daily for their survival in an often hostile urban landscape. In this collective biography, Rhonda Y. Williams takes us behind, and beyond, politically expedient labels to provide an incisive and intimate portrait of poor black women in urban America. Drawing on dozens of interviews, Williams challenges the notion that low-income housing was a resounding failure that doomed three consecutive generations of post-war Americans to entrenched poverty. Instead, she recovers a history of grass-roots activism, of political awakening, and of class mobility, all facilitated by the creation of affordable public housing. The stereotyping of black women, especially mothers, has obscured a complicated and nuanced reality too often warped by the political agendas of both the left and the right, and has prevented an accurate understanding of the successes and failures of government anti-poverty policy. At long last giving human form to a community of women who have too often been treated as faceless pawns in policy debates, Rhonda Y. Williams offers an unusually balanced and personal account of the urban war on poverty from the perspective of those who fought, and lived, it daily.},

  abstract = {To teachers of African-American history, August Meier is well respected as a first-rank scholar and editor. But few people are aware of his formative experiences in the two decades following World War II, as a white professor teaching at black colleges and as an activist in the civil rights movement. This volume brings together sixteen of his essays written between 1945 and 1965. Meier has added a substantial introduction, reflecting on those years and setting the context in which the essays were written. John H. Bracey, Jr., contributes an afterword which speaks to the uniqueness of Meier's experience among historians of African-American studies. The essays range from an analysis of the work of black sociologists in the twentieth century to an examination of race relations at predominantly black colleges in the 1950s, to case studies of nonviolent direct action in which Meier participated during the early 1960s. Of particular interest is an account of his debate with Malcolm X at Morgan State College in 1962, in which Malcolm X made the case for black nationalism and Meier defended the integrationist position. Collected for the first time, these essays provide a novel perspective on the early years of the civil rights movement and on the experience of historically black colleges such as Tougaloo, Fisk, and Morgan State.},

  abstract = {Though he lived throughout much of the South\textemdash{}and even worked his way into parts of the North for a time\textemdash{}Jim Crow was conceived and buried in Maryland. From Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney's infamous decision in the Dred Scott case to Thurgood Marshall's eloquent and effective work on Brown v. Board of Education, the battle for black equality is very much the story of Free State women and men. Here, Baltimore Sun columnist C. Fraser Smith recounts that tale through the stories, words, and deeds of famous, infamous, and little-known Marylanders. He traces the roots of Jim Crow laws from Dred Scott to Plessy v. Ferguson and describes the parallel and opposite early efforts of those who struggled to establish freedom and basic rights for African Americans. Following the historical trail of evidence, Smith relates latter-day examples of Maryland residents who trod those same steps, from the thrice-failed attempt to deny black people the vote in the early twentieth century to nascent demonstrations for open access to lunch counters, movie theaters, stores, golf courses, and other public and private institutions\textemdash{}struggles that occurred decades before the now-celebrated historical figures strode onto the national civil rights scene.

  abstract = {This rare grass-roots account of American communism traces the rise and fall of Maryland's Communist Party from the time of the Russian Revolution to the McCarthy era. Drawing on sources including the central archives of the Communist Party of the United States of America, recovered from remote storage in Siberia in 1993, Vernon L. Pedersen presents a sharp challenge to revisionist views of American communism as a benign domestic movement detached from Soviet interests. Bolsheviks in Baltimore charts the uneven transformation of Baltimore's fledgling Communists into underground revolutionaries in the 1920s. Pedersen documents the mercurial careers of local organizers, their devotion to the Soviet cause, and their efforts to convert the Party from a hodgepodge of ethnic groups to an effective instrument of class interests. He also tracks the public's changing perception of the Communists, from amused unconcern to alarm, and details how the Ober antisubversive law and the HUAC hearings of the 1950s dismantled the Party from without while planting seeds of paranoia that destroyed it from within. Behind the public fear of a Communist conspiracy against the U.S. government, Pedersen fin acting on Soviet orders, used their influence in unions and front groups to sway American foreign policy in ways that benefited the Soviet Union. He documents the consolidation of an espionage apparatus in Baltimore and demonstrates that while espionage activities may have involved only a few individuals, all Party members shared an attitude of willing support for the activities of the Soviet Union that made these covert practices possible. Paying tribute to the fervor and the effort dedicated by the Maryland Communists, often at the expense of their own physical and financial well-being, to a cause that ultimately failed them, Bolsheviks in Baltimore assesses an ambiguous legacy of admirable social vision, haphazard international conspiracy, and fierce internal conflict.},

  shorttitle = {Imperfect {{Equality}}},
  abstract = {In Imperfect Equality, Richard Fuke has explores the immediate aftermath of slavery in Maryland, which differed in important ways from the slaveholding states of the South: it never left the Union; white radicals had a period of access to power; and even prior to legal emancipation, a large free black population resided there. Moreover, the presence of Baltimore, a major city and port, provided abundant evidence with which to compare the rural and the urban experience of black Marylanders. This state study is therefore uniquely revealing of the successes and failures of the post-emancipation period. The transition in Maryland from a slave to a free society, Fuke argues, presented to black Marylanders opportunities to achieve previously inaccessible goals. Blacks were able to realize some goals, such as greater land ownership, control over the labor of their children, education, and the formation of independent cultural and social organizations, through their own intrepidity combined with the support of white radicals as well as with the assistance of the Freedmen's Bureau, the United States Army, and some state-controlled agencies. Other goals-such as social equality, economic opportunity and advancement, and suffrage-remained beyond the reach of blacks, not only because of conservative white opposition, but also, Fuke argues, because of the attitudinal limitations of white radicals unable to confront the full range of post-emancipation possibilities. Calling upon a very broad range of sources, Fuke demonstrates that after emancipation, Black Marylanders neither enjoyed total freedom nor suffered absolute coercion, but their struggle made two things clear: much of whatever they might accomplish, they would have to do by themselves; and such efforts would remain confined by white attitudes determined to regulate them.},

However, very little is known about the characteristics of these neighborhoods and of the residents who live in them. With data taken from a larger study of an integrated neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland, this article discusses homeowners' perceptions of their community and racial integration. Fifty semi-structured interviews were completed with 67 homeowners to investigate their perceptions and experiences of race, class, and change in their community. This study shows that statistical racial integration and perceptions of racial integration are two different factors. Residents define true racial integration as both residential and social. As a result, homeowners reported that their neighborhood is both segregated and integrated \textemdash{} a type of "qualified" integration. Perceptions of racial integration are also affected by inconsistently defined neighborhood boundaries and racial clustering, block by block.},

She also described her own education - growing up black in largely white Germantown, Pennsylvania; studying black history and culture for the first time at Cheyney State Teachers College; and meeting the rigorous demands of the program which she graduated from in 1949. In retracing her career, Williams examines the highs and lows of urban public education since World War II. She is at once an outspoken critic and spirited advocate of the system to which she devoted her life.},

The cases illustrate the paradoxical aspects of African American social capital in city-wide school reform while offering critical perspectives on current debates about privatization, site-based management, and other reform alternatives.

  abstract = {One of the best-known teams in the old Negro Leagues, the Elite Giants of Baltimore featured some of the outstanding African American players of the day. Sociologist and baseball writer Bob Luke narrates the untold story of the team and its interaction with the city and its people during the long years of segregation.To convey a sense of the action on the field and the major events in the team's history, Luke highlights important games, relives the standout performances of individual players, and discusses key decisions made by management. He introduces the team's eventual major league stars: Roy Campanella, who went on to a ten-year Hall of Fame career with the Brooklyn Dodgers; Joe Black, the first African American pitcher to win a World Series game; and James "Junior" Gilliam, a player and coach with the Dodgers for twenty-five years. Luke also describes the often contentious relationship between the team and major league baseball before, during, and after the major leagues were integrated.The Elite Giants did more than provide entertainment for Baltimore's black residents; the team and its star players broke the color barrier in the major leagues, giving hope to an African American community still oppressed by Jim Crow. In recounting the history of the Elite Giants, Luke reveals how the team, its personalities, and its fans raised public awareness of the larger issues faced by blacks in segregation-era Baltimore. Based on interviews with former players and Baltimore residents, articles from the black press of the time, and archival documents, and illustrated with previously unpublished photographs, The Baltimore Elite Giants recounts a barrier-breaking team's successes, failures, and eventual demise.},

  abstract = {As a border city Baltimore made an ideal arena to push for change during the civil rights movement. It was a city in which all forms of segregation and racism appeared vulnerable to attack by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's methods. If successful in Baltimore, the rest of the nation might follow with progressive and integrationist reforms. The Baltimore branch of the NAACP was one of the first chapters in the nation and was the largest branch in the nation by 1946. The branch undertook various forms of civil rights activity from 1914 through the 1940s that later were mainstays of the 1960s movement. Nonviolent protest, youth activism, economic boycotts, marches on state capitols, campaigns for voter registration, and pursuit of anti-lynching cases all had test runs. Remarkably, Baltimore's NAACP had the same branch president for thirty-five years starting in 1935, a woman, Lillie M. Jackson. Her work highlights gender issues and the social and political transitions among the changing civil rights groups. In Borders of Equality, Lee Sartain evaluates her leadership amid challenges from radicalized youth groups and the Black Power Movement. Baltimore was an urban industrial center that shared many characteristics with the North, and African Americans could vote there. The city absorbed a large number of black economic migrants from the South, and it exhibited racial patterns that made it more familiar to Southerners. It was one of the first places to begin desegregating its schools in September 1954 after the Brown decision, and one of the first to indicate to the nation that race was not simply a problem for the Deep South. Baltimore's history and geography make it a perfect case study to examine the NAACP and various phases of the civil rights struggle in the twentieth century},

  abstract = {This article looks at the debates surrounding Baltimore's 1910 Segregation Ordinance in transnational context. It asks whether the beliefs and actions of Baltimore's segregationists were connected to those deployed in hundreds of other efforts to segregate cities by race worldwide-in Asia, Africa, Australasia, and elsewhere in the Americas--during the same period. Using a comparison focussed on India, South Africa and the U.S., it argues that three interconnected and transnationally traded political conversations--concerning conflict between races "commingled" in the same geographic areas; concerning solutions of urban problems; and concerning middle-class control of urban property markets--were critical to urban segregationist discourse in places with otherwise very different histories. Because of local and national conditions, including well-organized black resistance, supporters of Baltimore's Ordinance drew on some of these languages more than others. Their heavy reliance on the argument that blacks threatened white property values was typical of the politics of America's "marketized" form of segregation, which threatens to become a transnational export in its own right. The paper seeks to use closely textured social-historical research and a wide-ranging synthetic reading of the history of cities elsewhere in the world as a means to understand and document world-historical phenomena.},

  abstract = {In 1968, Baltimore was home to a variety of ethnic, religious, and racial communities that, like those in other American cities, were confronting a quickly declining industrial base. In April of that year, disturbances broke the urban landscape along lines of race and class.This book offers chapters on events leading up to the turmoil, the riots, and the aftermath as well as four rigorously edited and annotated oral histories of members of the Baltimore community. The combination of new scholarship and first-person accounts provides a comprehensive case study of this period of civil unrest four decades later.This engaging, broad-based public history lays bare the diverse experiences of 1968 and their effects, emphasizing the role of specific human actions. By reflecting on the stories and analysis presented in this anthology, readers may feel empowered to pursue informed, responsible civic action of their own.Baltimore '68 is the book component of a larger public history project, "Baltimore '68 Riots: Riots and Rebirth." The project's companion website (http://archives.ubalt.edu/bsr/index.html ) offers many more oral histories plus photos, art, and links to archival sources. The book and the website together make up an invaluable teaching resource on cities, social unrest, and racial politics in the 1960s. The project was the corecipient of the 2009 Outstanding Public History Project Award from the National Council on Public History.},

Drawing from court records, the diaries, letters, and ledgers of farmers and small planters, and other archival sources, Max Grivno reconstructs how these poorest of southerners eked out their livings and struggled to maintain their families and their freedom in the often unforgiving rural economy.},

  abstract = {In Hirelings, Jennifer Dorsey recreates the social and economic milieu of Maryland's Eastern Shore at a time when black slavery and black freedom existed side by side. She follows a generation of manumitted African Americans and their freeborn children and grandchildren through the process of inventing new identities, associations, and communities in the early nineteenth century. Free Africans and their descendants had lived in Maryland since the seventeenth century, but before the American Revolution they were always few in number and lacking in economic resources or political leverage. By contrast, manumitted and freeborn African Americans in the early republic refashioned the Eastern Shore's economy and society, earning their livings as wage laborers while establishing thriving African American communities.

	As free workers in a slave society, these African Americans contested the legitimacy of the slave system even while they remained dependent laborers. They limited white planters' authority over their time and labor by reuniting their families in autonomous households, settling into free black neighborhoods, negotiating labor contracts that suited the needs of their households, and worshipping in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Some moved to the cities, but many others migrated between employers as a strategy for meeting their needs and thwarting employers' control. They demonstrated that independent and free African American communities could thrive on their own terms. In all of these actions the free black workers of the Eastern Shore played a pivotal role in ongoing debates about the merits of a free labor system.},

  shorttitle = {Standing {{Soldiers}}, {{Kneeling Slaves}}},
  abstract = {The United States of America originated as a slave society, holding millions of Africans and their descendants in bondage, and remained so until a civil war took the lives of a half million soldiers, some once slaves themselves. Standing Soldiers, Kneeling Slaves explores how that history of slavery and its violent end was told in public space--specifically in the sculptural monuments that increasingly came to dominate streets, parks, and town squares in nineteenth-century America. Here Kirk Savage shows how the greatest era of monument building in American history arose amidst struggles over race, gender, and collective memory. As men and women North and South fought to define the war's legacy in monumental art, they reshaped the cultural landscape of American nationalism.  At the same time that the Civil War challenged the nation to reexamine the meaning of freedom, Americans began to erect public monuments as never before. Savage studies this extraordinary moment in American history when a new interracial order seemed to be on the horizon, and when public sculptors tried to bring that new order into concrete form. Looking at monuments built and unbuilt, Savage shows how an old image of black slavery was perpetuated while a new image of the common white soldier was launched in public space. Faced with the challenge of Reconstruction, the nation ultimately recast itself in the mold of the ordinary white man.  Standing Soldiers, Kneeling Slaves, the first sustained investigation of monument building as a process of national and racial definition, probes a host of fascinating questions: How was slavery to be explained without exploding the myth of a "united" people? How did notions of heroism become racialized? And more generally, who is represented in and by monumental space? How are particular visions of history constructed by public monuments? Written in an engaging fashion, this book will appeal to a wide range of readers interested in American culture, race relations, and public art.},

  shorttitle = {Monuments to the {{Lost Cause}}},
  abstract = {This richly illustrated collection of fourteen essays examines the ways in which Confederate memorials - from Monument Avenue to Stone Mountain - and the public rituals surrounding them testify to the tenets of the Lost Cause, a romanticized narrative of the war. Several essays highlight the creative leading role played by women's groups in memorialization, while others explore the alternative ways in which people outside white southern culture wrote their very different histories on the southern landscape. The authors - who include Richard Guy Wilson, Catherine W. Bishir, W. Fitzhugh Brundage, and William M.S. Ramussen - trace the origins, objectives, and changing consequences of Confederate monuments over time and the dynamics of individuals and organizations that sponsored them. Thus these essays extend the growing literature on the rhetoric of the Lost Cause by shifting the focus to the realm of the visual. They are especially relevant in the present day when Confederate symbols and monuments continue to play a central role in a public - and often emotionally charged - debate about how the South's past should be remembered.  The editors: Art Historian Cynthia Mills, a specialist in nineteenth-century public sculpture, is executive editor of American Art, the scholarly journal of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Pamela H. Simpson is the Ernest Williams II Professor of Art History at Washington and Lee University. She is the coauthor of The Architecture of Historic Lexington.},

Even at its peak, in 2000, African American representation in engineering careers reached only 5.7 percent, while blacks made up 15 percent of the U.S. population. Some forty-five years after the Civil Rights Act sought to eliminate racial differences in education and employment, what do we make of an occupational pattern that perpetually follows the lines of race?  "Race, Rigor, and Selectivity in U.S. Engineering" pursues this question and its ramifications through historical case studies. Focusing on engineering programs in three settings--in Maryland, Illinois, and Texas, from the 1940s through the 1990s--Amy E. Slaton examines efforts to expand black opportunities in engineering as well as obstacles to those reforms. Her study reveals aspects of admissions criteria and curricular emphases that work against proportionate black involvement in many engineering programs. Slaton exposes the negative impact of conservative ideologies in engineering, and of specific institutional processes--ideas and practices that are as limiting for the field of engineering as they are for the goal of greater racial parity in the profession.},

In 1950s, southern politics laid the groundwork for the development of a more populist and more northern working class politics of race. In postwar Baltimore, working class Whites used a southern critique of society that hinged on "states' rights," "separate but equal," and "white supremacy" in forging a politics of race. In 1954, this southern critique was injected into state and local politics. By 1964, a new form of white working-class protest had begun to develop which was still built around race but had expanded to include a "liberal" elite. Lack of housing was Baltimore's main wartime problem. In East, many property owners subdivided their homes and businesses into apartments. Nevertheless, Baltimore natives and whites migrant workers found common ground on racial matters. Southern newcomers bolstered structures of workplace discrimination that predated the war.},

  abstract = {A stereotypical image of manumission is that of a benign plantation owner freeing his slaves on his deathbed. But as Stephen Whitman demonstrates, the truth was far more complex, especially in border states where manumission was much more common. Whitman analyzes the economic and social history of Baltimore to show how the vigorous growth of the city required the exploitation of rural slaves. To prevent them from escaping and to spur higher production, owners entered into arrangements with their slaves, promising eventual freedom in return for many years' hard work. The Price of Freedom reveals how blacks played a critical role in freeing themselves from slavery. Yet it was an imperfect victory. Once Baltimore's economic growth began to slow, freed blacks were virtually excluded from craft apprenticeships, and European immigrants supplanted them as a trained labor force.},

  shorttitle = {Scraping {{By}}},
  abstract = {Enslaved mariners, white seamstresses, Irish dockhands, free black domestic servants, and native-born street sweepers all navigated the low-end labor market in post-Revolutionary Baltimore. Seth Rockman considers this diverse workforce, exploring how race, sex, nativity, and legal status determined the economic opportunities and vulnerabilities of working families in the early republic.In the era of Frederick Douglass, Baltimore's distinctive economy featured many slaves who earned wages and white workers who performed backbreaking labor. By focusing his study on this boomtown, Rockman reassesses the roles of race and region and rewrites the history of class and capitalism in the United States during this time. Rockman describes the material experiences of low-wage workers\textemdash{}how they found work, translated labor into food, fuel, and rent, and navigated underground economies and social welfare systems. He also explores what happened if they failed to find work or lost their jobs. Rockman argues that the American working class emerged from the everyday struggles of these low-wage workers. Their labor was indispensable to the early republic's market revolution, and it was central to the transformation of the United States into the wealthiest society in the Western world. Rockman's research includes construction site payrolls, employment advertisements, almshouse records, court petitions, and the nation's first "living wage" campaign. These rich accounts of day laborers and domestic servants illuminate the history of early republic capitalism and its consequences for working families.},

In April of that year, disturbances broke the urban landscape along lines of race and class.This book offers chapters on events leading up to the turmoil, the riots, and the aftermath as well as four rigorously edited and annotated oral histories of members of the Baltimore community. The combination of new scholarship and first-person accounts provides a comprehensive case study of this period of civil unrest four decades later.This engaging, broad-based public history lays bare the diverse experiences of 1968 and their effects, emphasizing the role of specific human actions. By reflecting on the stories and analysis presented in this anthology, readers may feel empowered to pursue informed, responsible civic action of their own.Baltimore '68 is the book component of a larger public history project, "Baltimore '68 Riots: Riots and Rebirth." The project's companion website (http://archives.ubalt.edu/bsr/index.html ) offers many more oral histories plus photos, art, and links to archival sources. The book and the website together make up an invaluable teaching resource on cities, social unrest, and racial politics in the 1960s.

As these essays attest, Black self-determination was central to the methods African Americans employed in their quest to establish a sense of permanence and place in the United States.Contributors define space to include physical, social, and intellectual sites throughout the Northern and Southern regions of the United States, ranging from urban milieus to the suburbs and even to swamps and forests. They explore under-represented locations such as burial grounds, courtrooms, schools, and churches. Moreover, contributors demonstrate how Black consciousness and ideology challenged key concepts of American democracy - such as freedom, justice, citizenship, and equality - establishing African American space in social and intellectual areas.Ultimately, "We Shall Independent Be " recovers the voices of African American men and women from the antebellum United States through the present and chronicles their quest to assert their right to a place in American society. By identifying, examining, and telling the stories of contested sites, this volume demonstrates the power of African American self-definition and agency in the process of staking a physical and ideological claim to public space},

Topics covered include: - The contributions of statistical pioneers including Monroe Work, W.E.B.

The African-American Electorate features more than 300 tables, 150 figures, and 50 maps, many of which have been created exclusively for this work using demographic, voter registration, election return, and racial precinct data that have never been collected and assembled for the public. An appendix includes popular and electoral voting data for African-American presidential, congressional, and gubernatorial candidates, and a comprehensive bibliography indicates major topic areas and eras concerning the African-American electorate.

  abstract = {In this epic, beautifully written masterwork, Pulitzer Prize\textendash{}winning author Isabel Wilkerson chronicles one of the great untold stories of American history: the decades-long migration of black citizens who fled the South for northern and western cities, in search of a better life. From 1915 to 1970, this exodus of almost six million people changed the face of America. Wilkerson compares this epic migration to the migrations of other peoples in history. She interviewed more than a thousand people, and gained access to new data and official records, to write this definitive and vividly dramatic account of how these American journeys unfolded, altering our cities, our country, and ourselves.~With stunning historical detail, Wilkerson tells this story through the lives of three unique individuals: Ida Mae Gladney, who in 1937 left sharecropping and prejudice in Mississippi for Chicago, where she achieved quiet blue-collar success and, in old age, voted for Barack Obama when he ran for an Illinois Senate seat; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling, who in 1945 fled Florida for Harlem, where he endangered his job fighting for civil rights, saw his family fall, and finally found peace in God; and Robert Foster, who left Louisiana in 1953 to pursue a medical career, the personal physician to Ray Charles as part of a glitteringly successful medical career, which allowed him to purchase a grand home where he often threw exuberant parties.Wilkerson brilliantly captures their first treacherous and exhausting cross-country trips by car and train and their new lives in colonies that grew into ghettos, as well as how they changed these cities with southern food, faith, and culture and improved them with discipline, drive, and hard work. Both a riveting microcosm and a major assessment, The Warmth of Other Suns is a bold, remarkable, and riveting work, a superb account of an ``unrecognized immigration'' within our own land. Through the breadth of its narrative, the beauty of the writing, the depth of its research, and the fullness of the people and lives portrayed herein, this book is destined to become a classic.},

Taking the Boston Tea Party as his starting point, Lawrence Glickman argues that the rejection of British imports by revolutionary patriots inaugurated a continuous series of consumer boycotts, campaigns for safe and ethical consumption, and efforts to make goods more broadly accessible. He explores abolitionist-led efforts to eschew slave-made goods, African American consumer campaigns against Jim Crow, a 1930s refusal of silk from fascist Japan, and emerging contemporary movements like slow food. Uncovering previously unknown episodes and analyzing famous events from a fresh perspective, Glickman illuminates moments when consumer activism intersected with political and civil rights movements. He also sheds new light on activists' relationship with the consumer movement, which gave rise to lobbies like the National Consumers League and Consumers Union as well as ill-fated legislation to create a federal Consumer Protection Agency.},

But as Lizabeth Cohen makes clear, the pursuit of prosperity defined much more than the nation's economy; it also became a basic component of American citizenship. Consumers were encouraged to buy not just for themselves, but for the good of the nation.After a decade and a half of hard times resulting from the Great Depression and the war, the embrace of mass consumption, with its supposed far-reaching benefits\textemdash{}greater freedom, democracy, and equality\textemdash{}transformed American life. The extensive suburbanization of metropolitan areas (propelled by such government policies as the GI Bill), the shift from downtowns to shopping centers, and the advent of targeted marketing all fueled the consumer economy, but also sharpened divisions among Americans along gender, class, and racial lines. At the same time, mass consumption changed American politics, inspiring new forms of political activism through the civil rights and consumer movements and prompting politicians to apply the latest marketing strategies to their political campaigns.Cohen traces the legacy of the ``Consumers' Republic'' into our time, demonstrating how it has reshaped our relationship to government itself, with Americans increasingly judging public services\textemdash{}as if one more purchased good\textemdash{}by the personal benefits they derive from them.Brilliantly researched and reasoned, A Consumers' Republic is a starkly illuminating social and political history.},

With the appearance of his biography of Frederick Douglass in 1948, Quarles became a major contributor to the history of the black experience from the Revolutionary War through the Civil War. His leading works include the standard volumes on the role of Negroes in both of those conflicts, pioneering studies on black participation in the abolitionist movement, and two monographs on the interrelation between blacks and major white antislavery figures. Given the collective importance of this corpus of work, including the essays reprinted herein, we are all greatly in his debt. Quarles served as a model to a whole generation of scholars in Afro-American history, white and black alike. His syntheses of Civil War and abolition, his authoritative book and articles on the Revolution, his sensitive analysis of Lincoln and the blacks are all works that remain unequaled or unsurpassed. Even his pioneering Frederick Douglass remains a solid and highly respected monograph. The present and the next generation of historians are, and will be, writing from a later perspective and addressing themselves to different questions, but Quarles's works not only plowed new ground; they will live as standard treatments of topics for years to come.},

  shorttitle = {Radical {{Sisters}}},
  abstract = {Radical Sisters is a fresh exploration of the ways that 1960s political movements shaped local, grassroots feminism in Washington, D.C. Rejecting notions of a universal sisterhood, Anne M. Valk argues that activists periodically worked to bridge differences for the sake of improving women's plight, even while maintaining distinct political bases. Washington, D.C. is a critical site for studying the dynamics of the feminist movement, not only for its strategic location vis-a-vis the federal government but because in 1970 over seventy percent of the city's population was African American. While most historiography on the subject tends to portray the feminist movement as deeply divided over issues of race, Valk presents a more nuanced account, showing feminists of various backgrounds both coming together to promote a notion of "sisterhood" and being deeply divided along the lines of class, race, and sexuality. In exploring women's unity (or lack thereof) in the liberation movement, Valk shows how African American women activists, who were primarily focused on racial and economic justice, influenced and provided important opposition to the organizational activities of white women.  Going beyond self-identified Washington feminists to include critics, outsiders, occasional supporters, and those supportive of the movement but not directly affiliated with it, Valk documents interactions between groups working against sexism, racism, and poverty.~Radical Sisters uncovers the fruitful, but often divisive, connections between movements for urban change, welfare rights, reproductive control, and black liberation, while detailing their impact on the ideas, ideals, and activities embraced by modern feminism.},

  abstract = {In this paper the author offers a reprint of "Equality of Opportunity: The Making of the Americans with Disabilities Act" (July 26, 1997). This personal story is part and parcel of the ADA's (Americans with Disabilities Act) significance in the society. The ADA is a nondiscrimination law. It is a clarion call for transforming attitudes about disability. The ADA proclaims that all people, including people with disabilities, should participate fully in all aspects of communities and have opportunities to take risks, to succeed, and--yes--to fail. Equality of opportunity means having a chance to live independently and become financially secure, but it is not a guarantee. Understanding the history of the ADA is every bit as important as when "Equality of Opportunity" was first published in 1997. Arguably, the urgency is even greater now. Achieving equality of opportunity for people with disabilities depends in large measure on individual transformative experiences like the one the author had through writing the history of the ADA. Thus, the author hopes that this reprint of "Equality of Opportunity" enables more people to understand the ADA and the outmoded structural and attitudinal barriers it was meant to tear down.

Both sides fought to define the conflict on their own terms\textemdash{}Lincoln and his supporters struggled to preserve the Union and end slavery, while the Confederacy waged a battle for the primacy of local liberty or "states' rights." But the war had its own peculiar effects on the four border slave states that remained loyal to the Union.

  isbn = {978-0-8018-9830-3},
  shorttitle = {Knights of the {{Razor}}},
  abstract = {Black barbers, reflected a freed slave who barbered in antebellum St. Louis, may have been "the only men in their community who enjoyed, at all times, the privilege of free speech." The reason, of course, lay in their temporary\textemdash{}but absolute\textemdash{}power over a client. With a flick of the wrist, 19th-century black barbers could have slit the throats of the white men they shaved. In Knights of the Razor, Douglas Walter Bristol, Jr., explores this extraordinary relationship in the largely untold story of African American barbers, North and South, from the American Revolution to the First World War. Besides establishing the modern-day barbershop, these barbers used their skilled trade to navigate the many pitfalls that racism created for ambitious black men. They dominated an upscale market that catered to prosperous white men. At the same time, their respect for labor itself preserved their ties to the black community. Successful barbers assumed leadership roles in their localities, helping to form a black middle class despite pervasive racial segregation. They advocated economic independence from whites and founded insurance companies that became some of the largest black-owned corporations. Bristol engagingly narrates this story of skilled blacks and elite whites. More broadly, he offers a thoughtful study of the nuances of race relations and the ingenuity of black enterprise. Knights of the Razor tackles a rich and tangled subject. -- L. Diane Barnes},

Vann Woodward, who died in 1999 at the age of 91, was America's most eminent Southern historian, the winner of a Pulitzer Prize for Mary Chestnut's Civil War and a Bancroft Prize for The Origins of the New South. Now, to honor his long and truly distinguished career, Oxford is pleased to publish this special commemorative edition of Woodward's most influential work, The Strange Career of Jim Crow. The Strange Career of Jim Crow is one of the great works of Southern history. Indeed, the book actually helped shape that history. Published in 1955, a year after the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education ordered schools desegregated, Strange Career was cited so often to counter arguments for segregation that Martin Luther King, Jr. called it "the historical Bible of the civil rights movement." The book offers a clear and illuminating analysis of the history of Jim Crow laws, presenting evidence that segregation in the South dated only to the 1890s. Woodward convincingly shows that, even under slavery, the two races had not been divided as they were under the Jim Crow laws of the 1890s. In fact, during Reconstruction, there was considerable economic and political mixing of the races. The segregating of the races was a relative newcomer to the region. Hailed as one of the top 100 nonfiction works of the twentieth century, The Strange Career of Jim Crow has sold almost a million copies and remains, in the words of David Herbert Donald, "a landmark in the history of American race relations."},

  abstract = {A Publisher's Weekly Top 10 Best Books of 2017 Long-listed for the National Book Award "Rothstein has presented what I consider to be the most forceful argument ever published on how federal, state, and local governments gave rise to and reinforced neighborhood segregation." \rule{1em}{1pt}William Julius WilsonIn this groundbreaking history of the modern American metropolis, Richard Rothstein, a leading authority on housing policy, explodes the myth that America's cities came to be racially divided through de facto segregation\rule{1em}{1pt}that is, through individual prejudices, income differences, or the actions of private institutions like banks and real estate agencies. Rather, The Color of Law incontrovertibly makes clear that it was de jure segregation\rule{1em}{1pt}the laws and policy decisions passed by local, state, and federal governments\rule{1em}{1pt}that actually promoted the discriminatory patterns that continue to this day.Through extraordinary revelations and extensive research that Ta-Nehisi Coates has lauded as "brilliant" (The Atlantic), Rothstein comes to chronicle nothing less than an untold story that begins in the 1920s, showing how this process of de jure segregation began with explicit racial zoning, as millions of African Americans moved in a great historical migration from the south to the north.As Jane Jacobs established in her classic The Death and Life of Great American Cities, it was the deeply flawed urban planning of the 1950s that created many of the impoverished neighborhoods we know. Now, Rothstein expands our understanding of this history, showing how government policies led to the creation of officially segregated public housing and the demolition of previously integrated neighborhoods. While urban areas rapidly deteriorated, the great American suburbanization of the post\textendash{}World War II years was spurred on by federal subsidies for builders on the condition that no homes be sold to African Americans. Finally, Rothstein shows how police and prosecutors brutally upheld these standards by supporting violent resistance to black families in white neighborhoods.The Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibited future discrimination but did nothing to reverse residential patterns that had become deeply embedded. Yet recent outbursts of violence in cities like Baltimore, Ferguson, and Minneapolis show us precisely how the legacy of these earlier eras contributes to persistent racial unrest. ``The American landscape will never look the same to readers of this important book'' (Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund), as Rothstein's invaluable examination shows that only by relearning this history can we finally pave the way for the nation to remedy its unconstitutional past. 13 illustrations},

The truth of who Rosa Parks was and what really lay beneath the 1955 boycott is far different from anything previously written. In this groundbreaking and important book, Danielle McGuire writes about the rape in 1944 of a twenty-four-year-old mother and sharecropper, Recy Taylor, who strolled toward home after an evening of singing and praying at the Rock Hill Holiness Church in Abbeville, Alabama. Seven white men, armed with knives and shotguns, ordered the young woman into their green Chevrolet, raped her, and left her for dead. The president of the local NAACP branch office sent his best investigator and organizer--Rosa Parks--to Abbeville. In taking on this case, Parks launched a movement that exposed a ritualized history of sexual assault against black women and added fire to the growing call for change.},

In fact, racist thought is alive and well in America--more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues in Stamped from the Beginning, if we have any hope of grappling with this stark reality, we must first understand how racist ideas were developed, disseminated, and enshrined in American society. In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-Black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. Stamped from the Beginning uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to offer a window into the contentious debates between assimilationists and segregationists and between racists and antiracists. From Puritan minister Cotton Mather to Thomas Jefferson, from fiery abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to brilliant scholar W.E.B. Du Bois to legendary anti-prison activist Angela Davis, Kendi shows how and why some of our leading proslavery and pro-civil rights thinkers have challenged or helped cement racist ideas in America. Contrary to popular conceptions, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. Instead, they were devised and honed by some of the most brilliant minds of each era. These intellectuals used their brilliance to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation's racial disparities in everything from wealth to health. And while racist ideas are easily produced and easily consumed, they can also be discredited. In shedding much-needed light on the murky history of racist ideas, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose them--and in the process, gives us reason to hope.

  abstract = {Maryland, as one of 17 states that had de jure segregation, has an intense history of school segregation. Following the 1954 Brown decision, school districts across the state employed various methods to desegregate their schools, including mandatory busing in Prince George's County, magnet schools in Montgomery County, and a freedom of choice plan in Baltimore. Although the districts made some progress in desegregating their schools, after plans that had the explicit goal of decreasing segregation ended, many of the schools in Maryland again reached high levels of segregation. This report investigates trends in school segregation in Maryland over the last two decades by examining concentration, exposure, and evenness measures by both race and class. After exploring the overall enrollment patterns and segregation trends at the state level, this report turns to the Baltimore-Washington CMSA to analyze similar measures of segregation. Given the trends presented in this report, it is likely that segregation will continue to intensify if nothing is done to address it. Having already reached high levels of segregation for the state's students of color, it is necessary that Maryland now take steps to reverse these trends by being proactive in addressing the segregated nature of its public schools. Appended are: (1) Additional Data Tables; and (2) Data Sources and Methodology. (Contains 32 tables, 20 figures and 83 footnotes.) [Foreword by Gary Orfield.

In public hearings in St. Louis, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., between January 1970 and June 1971, the Commission documented the problem with the testimony of more than 150 witnesses. Further testimony was gathered by the Commission's State Advisory Committees in these cities and in Boston, Milwaukee, and Phoenix. The report concludes that despite a plethora of far-reaching remedial legislation, a dual housing market continues today in most metropolitan areas across the United States. Inadequate enforcement by Federal agencies and circumvention or, at best, lip-service adherence by local authorities, builders,  real estate agents, and others involved in the development of suburban communities have helped to perpetuate the systematic exclusion of minorities and low-income families. The result has been the growth of overwhelmingly white, largely affluent suburbs, and the concurrent deterioration of central cities, overburdened by inordinately large and constantly increasing percentages of poor and minority residents. Two of the sectors hardest hit by extensive residential segregation have been education and employment. (Author/JM)},

  abstract = {Amidst the violent racism prevalent at the turn of the twentieth century, African American cultural elites, struggling to articulate a positive black identity, developed a middle-class ideology of racial uplift. Insisting that they were truly representative of the race's potential, black elites espoused an ethos of self-help and service to the black masses and distinguished themselves from the black majority as agents of civilization; hence the phrase 'uplifting the race.' A central assumption of racial uplift ideology was that African Americans' material and moral progress would diminish white racism. But Kevin Gaines argues that, in its emphasis on class distinctions and patriarchal authority, racial uplift ideology was tied to pejorative notions of racial pathology and thus was limited as a force against white prejudice. Drawing on the work of W. E. B. Du Bois, Anna Julia Cooper, Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Hubert H. Harrison, and others, Gaines focuses on the intersections between race and gender in both racial uplift ideology and black nationalist thought, showing that the meaning of uplift was intensely contested even among those who shared its aims. Ultimately, elite conceptions of the ideology retreated from more democratic visions of uplift as social advancement, leaving a legacy that narrows our conceptions of rights, citizenship, and social justice.},

  abstract = {African American Civil Rights: Early Activism and the Niagara Movement tells a fascinating story, one that is too frequently marginalized. Offering the first full-length, comprehensive sociological analysis of the Niagara Movement, which existed between 1905 and 1910, the book demonstrates that, although short-lived, the movement was far from a failure. Rather, it made the need to annihilate Jim Crow and address the atrocities caused by slavery publicly visible, creating a foundation for more widely celebrated mid-20th-century achievements.This unique study focuses on what author Angela Jones terms black publics, groups of concerned citizens\textemdash{}men and women, alike\textemdash{}who met to shift public opinion. The book explores their pivotal role in initiating the civil rights movement, specifically examining secular organizations, intellectual circles, the secular black press, black honor societies and clubs, and prestigious educational networks. All of these, Jones convincingly demonstrates, were seminal to the development of civil rights protest in the early 20th century.},

  abstract = {Despite recent advances in the study of black thought, black women intellectuals remain often neglected. This collection of essays by fifteen scholars of history and literature establishes black women's places in intellectual history by engaging the work of writers, educators, activists, religious leaders, and social reformers in the United States, Africa, and the Caribbean. Dedicated to recovering the contributions of thinkers marginalized by both their race and their gender, these essays uncover the work of unconventional intellectuals, both formally educated and self-taught, and explore the broad community of ideas in which their work participated. The end result is a field-defining and innovative volume that addresses topics ranging from religion and slavery to the politicized and gendered reappraisal of the black female body in contemporary culture.

But these twoflagship institutions were not the first important national organizations devoted to advancing the cause of racial justice. Instead, it was even earlier groups - including the National Afro American League, the National Afro American Council, the National Association of Colored Women, and theNiagara Movement - that developed and transmitted to the NAACP and National Urban League foundational ideas about law and lawyering that these latter organizations would then pursue. With unparalleled scholarly depth, Defining the Struggle explores these forerunner organizations whose contributions in shaping early twentieth century national civil rights organizing have largely been forgotten today. It examines the motivations of their leaders, the initiatives they undertook,and the ideas about law and racial justice activism they developed and passed on to future generations. In so doing, it sheds new light on how these early origins helped set the path for twentieth century legal civil rights activism in the United States.},

  shorttitle = {At the {{Hands}} of {{Persons Unknown}}},
  abstract = {It is easy to shrink from our country's brutal history of lynching. Lynching is called the last great skeleton in our nation's closet: It terrorized all of black America, claimed thousands upon thousands of victims in the decades between the 1880s and the Second World War, and leaves invisible but deep scars to this day. The cost of pushing lynching into the shadows, however--misremembering it as isolated acts perpetrated by bigots on society's fringes--is insupportably high: Until we understand how pervasive and socially accepted the practice was--and, more important, why this was so--it will haunt all efforts at racial reconciliation. "I could not suppress the thought," James Baldwin once recalled of seeing the red clay hills of Georgia on his first trip to the South, "that this earth had acquired its color from the blood that had dripped down from these trees." Throughout America, not just in the South, blacks accused of a crime--or merely of violating social or racial customs--were hunted by mobs, abducted from jails, and given summary "justice" in blatant defiance of all guarantees of due process under law. Men and women were shot, hanged, tortured, and burned, often in sadistic, picnic-like "spectacle lynchings" involving thousands of witnesses. "At the hands of persons unknown" was the official verdict rendered on most of these atrocities. The celebrated historian Philip Dray shines a clear, bright light on this dark history--its causes, perpetrators, apologists, and victims. He also tells the story of the men and women who led the long and difficult fight to expose and eradicate lynching, including Ida B. Wells, James Weldon Johnson, Walter White, and W.E.B. Du Bois. Iflynching is emblematic of what is worst about America, their fight may stand for what is best: the love of justice and fairness and the conviction that one individual's sense of right can suffice to defy the gravest of wrongs. This landmark book follows the trajectory of both forces over American history--and makes the history of lynching belong to us all.},

  abstract = {Winner of the Christopher Award and the New York City Book Award  Winner of the 2016 Wheatley Book Award in Nonfiction  A history of African Americans in New York City from the 1910s to 1960, told through the life of Samuel Battle, the New York Police Department's first black officer.  When Samuel Battle broke the color line as New York City's first African American cop in the second decade of the twentieth century, he had to fear his racist colleagues as much as criminals. He had to be three times better than his white peers, and many times more resilient. His life was threatened. He was displayed like a circus animal. Yet, fearlessly claiming his rights, he prevailed in a four-decade odyssey that is both the story of one man's courageous dedication to racial progress and a harbinger of the divisions between police and the people they serve that plague twenty-first-century America.  By dint of brains, brawn, and an outsized personality, Battle rode the forward wave of African American history in New York. He circulated among renowned turn-of-the-century entertainers and writers. He weathered threatening hostility as a founding citizen of black Harlem. He served as "godfather" to the regiment of black soldiers that won glory in World War I as the "Hellfighters of Harlem." He befriended sports stars like Joe Louis, Jesse Owens, and Sugar Ray Robinson, and he bonded with legendary tap dancer Bill "Bojangles" Robinson. Along the way, he mentored an equally smart, equally tough young man in a still more brutal fight to integrate the New York Fire Department.  At the close of his career, Battle looked back proudly on the against-all-odd journey taken by a man who came of age as the son of former slaves in the South. He had navigated the corruption of Tammany Hall, the treachery of gangsters like Lucky Luciano and Dutch Schultz, the anything-goes era of Prohibition, the devastation of the Depression, and the race riots that erupted in Harlem in the 1930s and 1940s. By then he was a trusted aide to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and a friend to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.  Realizing that his story was the story of race in New York across the first half of the century, Battle commissioned a biography to be written by none other than Langston Hughes, the preeminent voice of the Harlem Renaissance. But their eighty-thousand-word collaboration failed to find a publisher, and has remained unpublished since. Using Hughes's manuscript, which is quoted liberally throughout this book, as well as his own archival research and interviews with survivors, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Arthur Browne has created an important and compelling social history of New York, revealed a fascinating episode in the life of Langston Hughes, and delivered the riveting life and times of a remarkable and unjustly forgotten man, setting Samuel Battle where he belongs in the pantheon of American civil rights pioneers.

  shorttitle = {Baltimore},
  abstract = {The unique appeal of an older city lies in its history and diversity--the mix of events, peoples, styles, and circumstances that give a place its special character. As the city of Baltimore celebrates its bicentennial in 1997, its citizens can look with renewed pride and interest to a heritage that includes a colorful history, architectural treasures, diverse ethnic neighborhoods, world-renowned institutions, and a reinvented waterfront that combines tourism and industry. First published in 1980 -- at the height of the city's acclaimed "renaissance" -- Baltimore: The Building of an American City offered a lively, well-illustrated history of the city's growth, development, and challenges. In this expanded bicentennial edition, Sherry H. Olson brings Baltimore's story up to date with a new chapter and new illustrations. Olson describes the "boom and bust" urban development that makes Baltimore's experience typical of urban centers around the world. She also notes the ongoing search for solutions to problems such as poverty, unemployment, racial tension, labor disputes, and the inevitable conflicts between the public and private sectors and urban and suburban interests. This new edition of Baltimore: The Building of an American City helps us understand why the city has always won the hearts of residents and visitors -- and fascinated historians and students of urban development."Discover how and why the city grew as it did... [An] exhaustive book which should be of interest not only to scholars but to all Baltimoreans and in fact to all city dwellers--for the light that Olson throws on the city's past could well help to indicate some of the choices we ought--and ought not--to makefor the future." -- Baltimore Sun"Olson's book is a serious, handsomely designed and produced history. [With] its large format and its many, effectively used black-and-white photographs and illustrations, this book is intended to be read and not just skimmed." -- Washington Post Book World},
