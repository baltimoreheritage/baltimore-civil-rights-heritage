What were the forces that led to the citywide renovation of Baltimore's rowhouses? The Baltimore Rowhouse is the fascinating 200-year story of this building type. It chronicles the evolution of the rowhouse from its origins as speculative housing for immigrants, through its reclamation and renovation by young urban pioneers thanks to local government sponsorship, to its current occupation by a new cadre of wealthy professionals. The Baltimore Rowhouse was winner of the 2000 Maryland Historical Trust Heritage Book Award for outstanding books of scholarly or general interest.},

  abstract = {The Kerr v. Pratt (1945) decision was monumental in helping to dismantle institutionalized segregation in Baltimore that was practiced by many of the city's public institutions. This case illustrates how African-Americans in Baltimore began to achieve their full-fledged Civil Rights by using the concept of unfair employment practices as a stepping stone for achieving complete racial integration nationally.
This paper will examine this case from a Black Nationalist perspective and will emphasize the 1945 District Court of Maryland case, analyzing its impact in assisting African-Americans in Baltimore to achieve progress educationally or occupationally. This study is based on primary sources including reports in the Baltimore Sun and the Afro-American newspapers, law reviews, articles and other primary sources such as legal dockets, letters, report cards and receipts. In addition, Louise Kerr the defendant of the case and Law Professor Larry Gibson were interviewed to help provide essential information to this work.
This study is important because it illustrates how Kerr and her community helped to lay the groundwork for later Civil Rights achievements in American courts. The Kerr v. Pratt (1945) raised major questions about race, segregation and institutional discrimination in the Baltimore public sector. Hence, its ramifications were far-reaching and received national acclaim as it contributed to the renowned Brown v. Board of Education (1954). This case shows how ordinary citizens like Louise Kerr and prominent jurist like Charles Hamilton Houston worked together to bring social and economic change to the oppressed community of Baltimore.},

  shorttitle = {``{{Tramping}} for Justice''},
  abstract = {In May 1954 the United States Supreme Court ruled that segregation in education was unconstitutional. Schools were given one year to desegregate. The Baltimore City School Board, however, ordered immediate compliance, effective the following fall. There was hesitation on the part of some in the larger community, defiance on the part of others, but the school year would proceed largely without incident. In many ways, the relative ease of the transition can be traced to the twelve years immediately prior to Brown and to the watershed event of the April 1942 March on Annapolis. During that elapse of time, the wall of Jim Crow was in effect, dismantled\textemdash{}taken down brick by brick. Victories against compulsory race segregation, ``Jim Crow'' segregation, in other areas prepared Baltimore for its inevitable demise in education.
Recently, historians have worked to broaden perceptions of the underlying continuities of African American struggle for civil rights. Much of this revision has involved the aspect of time, placing the so-called Modern Civil Rights Movement (1954\textendash{}1965) within broader chronological contexts. While the aspect of time will likely continue to be revisited, another possible avenue for revision that has yet to receive necessary attention, is the movement's comprehensiveness\textemdash{}its spaces. As important perhaps as issues of chronology is the breadth of concurrent contests over the various social spaces\textemdash{}residential, public, educational, and employment, for example.
Through an examination of Baltimore during the period 1942\textendash{}1954, this study will demonstrate that what may be termed in the singular as ``the'' struggle was in actuality many battles being waged simultaneously in multiple walks of life, in the various spaces of existence, and by many of the same folk. Though subtle, indirect, and non-coordinated, the multifaceted ``attack'' on discrimination brought about a call for an end to Jim Crow segregation.
Where appropriate, this study pointedly distinguishes between Jim Crow segregation (the laws that kept blacks and whites off of the same public golf courses or public tennis courts, for example, even when they wanted to play together), and Jim Crow discrimination (the practice of hotels, department stores, and lunch counters of treating white patrons different than blacks, though not compelled to do so by law). Jim Crow segregation was compulsory. Jim Crow discrimination was undertaken voluntarily.
This study is principally concerned with the demise of Jim Crow segregation in Baltimore. This study does not, however, attempt to detail, explore, or even suggest the end of discrimination and racial inequity in that city. The dismantling of Jim Crow statutes was but an important step in the process. Though the post-1954 aspects of the process itself would retrace many of the areas covered here, non-discrimination and racial equity would not be achieved for several decades following Brown. Many would argue that it has yet to be achieved.},

This essay examines the events leading up to the rebellion, media and public perceptions of the rebellion, and the impact of the rebellion.
Sources include committee reports, correspondence, newspaper articles, photographs, oral interviews, books, and essays.
Research revealed that many cities across the country responded similarly to King's death; however, it was not his death alone that caused the rebellion. In addition, there was no homogenous viewpoint among any one group of people regarding the uprising. The rebellion did not directly have a visible positive impact as many of the problems with race relations, housing, crime and education in Baltimore that budded in the 1960s increased in the years following the civil disturbance.},

I concentrate upon the infection of a specific locale\textemdash{}Baltimore\textemdash{}with white supremacist language. White Baltimoreans adhered to a complex and dense mass of ideas and images based on the assumption of black inferiority. My work combines two strands of historiography that are generally treated separately. I compliment African American historiography and studies of white racial ideas by treating both in a local study. I find a vast gulf between white Baltimorean's imagery of African Americans and the way that the free black population of the city conducted their lives. White Baltimoreans perceived free blacks as a despicable group whose natural condition was enslavement. They imagined free black people as promiscuous, irresponsible, undisciplined, and incapable of any but the most fleeting emotional ties. Baltimore whites did not see that the city's free blacks contradicted degrading ideas projected upon them by overcoming difficult conditions to live autonomously from whites in a lawful, dignified, and responsible manner.
I concentrate upon the infection of a specific locale-Baltimore-with white supremacist language. White Baltimoreans adhered to a complex and dense mass of ideas and images based on the assumption of black inferiority. I focus upon white perceptions of free African Americans through a variety of lenses. Racial ideology emanated from the pulpit, press, scientific authorities, and the public square to create consistent imagery of African Americans. I argue that free African Americans in Baltimore put the lie to white supremacist ideology by transcending abysmal rural conditions to live dignified, largely independent lives.},

  abstract = {The study examines the apprenticeship system in Maryland during a period of 1661 to 1865 as it pertains to blacks, and as revealed by Maryland court records. Apprenticeship represented one of the earliest forms of education for blacks in Maryland. The study traces the history of apprenticeship from the Greeks and Romans, to the colony of Maryland. Differences of apprenticeship in England and the British West Indies are noted. Cases reviewed of black apprentices before the courts in England before 1800 are described and they show that no laws were established or distinctions made in court decisions based on race or class.
A description of Maryland's apprenticeship system is presented and compared with England's system. While England passed no prohibitive laws against black apprentices, Maryland's apprenticeship law of 1793 did eliminate the requirement to teach black apprentices to read and to write. Despite this prohibitive law, black apprentices continued to have contracts that contained provisions for literacy. In addition to opportunities for literacy, apprenticeship in Maryland afforded some blacks the opportunity for learning and such lucrative crafts as blacksmithing and woodworking.
Employment in these trades as journeymen sometimes led to blacks being able to buy land and retain it long enough to pass it on to the next generation. A description is also given of Maryland's topography and its influence in fostering trades. The industries of tobacco, grain, and ship building provided an array of skilled occupations for which some blacks were apprenticed. However, the availability of these occupations to black apprentices was sometimes influenced by social, political and economic factors.
By the beginning of the nineteenth century, black journeymen were able to form their own unions for some trades, contribute financially toward the building of schools and to sponsor literary societies.},

Lion in the Lobby chronicles Mitchell's life story and mission of getting the Congress to join the courts and the Executive Branch in upholding the Constitution in order to fulfill the NAACP's egalitarian philosophy. He worked with seven presidents, from Harry Truman to Jimmy Carter, to build a legacy of advocacy that won him the popular moniker of 101st senator and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1978. This revised edition is strengthened by a detailed account of the bitter battle within the NAACP over Mitchell's retirement.

  abstract = {What is life for the individual caged in a six-by-nine-foot cell?  In 1970 the feds framed Marshall \dbend{}Eddie\dbend{} Conway for the murder of a Baltimore city police officer. He was twenty-four years old. They threw him in prison; took him away from his family, his friends, and his organizing; and tried to relegate him to a life marked by nothing but legal appeals, riots and lockdowns, and transfers from one penal colony to the next. But they failed.  Forty years later, still incarcerated for a crime he didn\dbend{}t commit, Eddie Conway continues to resist. From his childhood in inner-city Baltimore to his political awakening in the military, from the rise of the Black Panther Party to the sham trial, the realities of prison life, escape attempts, labor organizing on the inside, and beyond, Eddie\dbend{}s autobiography is a reminder that we all share the responsibility of resistance, no matter where we are.

  shorttitle = {Here {{Lies Jim Crow}}},
  abstract = {Though he lived throughout much of the South\textemdash{}and even worked his way into parts of the North for a time\textemdash{}Jim Crow was conceived and buried in Maryland. From Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney's infamous decision in the Dred Scott case to Thurgood Marshall's eloquent and effective work on Brown v. Board of Education, the battle for black equality is very much the story of Free State women and men. Here, Baltimore Sun columnist C. Fraser Smith recounts that tale through the stories, words, and deeds of famous, infamous, and little-known Marylanders. He traces the roots of Jim Crow laws from Dred Scott to Plessy v. Ferguson and describes the parallel and opposite early efforts of those who struggled to establish freedom and basic rights for African Americans. Following the historical trail of evidence, Smith relates latter-day examples of Maryland residents who trod those same steps, from the thrice-failed attempt to deny black people the vote in the early twentieth century to nascent demonstrations for open access to lunch counters, movie theaters, stores, golf courses, and other public and private institutions\textemdash{}struggles that occurred decades before the now-celebrated historical figures strode onto the national civil rights scene. Smith's lively account includes the grand themes and the state's major players in the movement\textemdash{}Frederick Douglass, Harriett Tubman, Thurgood Marshall, and Lillie May Jackson, among others\textemdash{}and also tells the story of the struggle via several of Maryland's important but relatively unknown men and women\textemdash{}such as Gloria Richardson, John Prentiss Poe, William L. "Little Willie" Adams, and Walter Sondheim\textemdash{}who prepared Jim Crow's grave and waited for the nation to deliver the body.},

  title = {The {{Communist Party}} in {{Maryland}}, 1919-57},
  isbn = {978-0-252-02321-7},
  abstract = {This rare grass-roots account of American communism traces the rise and fall of Maryland's Communist Party from the time of the Russian Revolution to the McCarthy era. Drawing on sources including the central archives of the Communist Party of the United States of America, recovered from remote storage in Siberia in 1993, Vernon L. Pedersen presents a sharp challenge to revisionist views of American communism as a benign domestic movement detached from Soviet interests. Bolsheviks in Baltimore charts the uneven transformation of Baltimore's fledgling Communists into underground revolutionaries in the 1920s. Pedersen documents the mercurial careers of local organizers, their devotion to the Soviet cause, and their efforts to convert the Party from a hodgepodge of ethnic groups to an effective instrument of class interests. He also tracks the public's changing perception of the Communists, from amused unconcern to alarm, and details how the Ober antisubversive law and the HUAC hearings of the 1950s dismantled the Party from without while planting seeds of paranoia that destroyed it from within. Behind the public fear of a Communist conspiracy against the U.S. government, Pedersen fin acting on Soviet orders, used their influence in unions and front groups to sway American foreign policy in ways that benefited the Soviet Union. He documents the consolidation of an espionage apparatus in Baltimore and demonstrates that while espionage activities may have involved only a few individuals, all Party members shared an attitude of willing support for the activities of the Soviet Union that made these covert practices possible. Paying tribute to the fervor and the effort dedicated by the Maryland Communists, often at the expense of their own physical and financial well-being, to a cause that ultimately failed them, Bolsheviks in Baltimore assesses an ambiguous legacy of admirable social vision, haphazard international conspiracy, and fierce internal conflict.},

  abstract = {This pioneering work brings together for the first time in a single reference work all of the extant, fugitive, and recently discovered registration data on African American voters from Colonial America to the present. It features election returns for African American presidential, senatorial, congressional, and gubernatorial candidates over time. Rich, insightful narrative explains the data and traces the history of the laws dealing with the enfranchisement and disenfranchisement of African Americans.   Topics covered include: - The contributions of statistical pioneers including Monroe Work, W.E.B. DuBois and Ralph Bunche - African American organizations, like the NAACP and National Equal Rights League (NERL)  - Pioneering African American officeholders, including the few before the Civil War - Four influxes of African American voters: Reconstruction (Southern African American men), the Fifteenth Amendment (African American men across the country), the Nineteenth Amendment (African American female voters in 1920 election), and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 - The historical development of disenfranchisement in the South and the statistical impact of the tools of disenfranchisement: literacy clauses, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses.  The African-American Electorate features more than 300 tables, 150 figures, and 50 maps, many of which have been created exclusively for this work using demographic, voter registration, election return, and racial precinct data that have never been collected and assembled for the public. An appendix includes popular and electoral voting data for African-American presidential, congressional, and gubernatorial candidates, and a comprehensive bibliography indicates major topic areas and eras concerning the African-American electorate.  The African American Electorate offers students and researchers the opportunity, for the first time, to explore the relationship between voters and political candidates, identify critical variables, and situate African Americans' voting behavior and political phenomena in the context of America's political history.},

  abstract = {A definitive history of consumer activism, Buying Power traces the lineage of this political tradition back to our nation's founding, revealing that Americans used purchasing power to support causes and punish enemies long before the word boycott even entered our lexicon. Taking the Boston Tea Party as his starting point, Lawrence Glickman argues that the rejection of British imports by revolutionary patriots inaugurated a continuous series of consumer boycotts, campaigns for safe and ethical consumption, and efforts to make goods more broadly accessible. He explores abolitionist-led efforts to eschew slave-made goods, African American consumer campaigns against Jim Crow, a 1930s refusal of silk from fascist Japan, and emerging contemporary movements like slow food. Uncovering previously unknown episodes and analyzing famous events from a fresh perspective, Glickman illuminates moments when consumer activism intersected with political and civil rights movements. He also sheds new light on activists' relationship with the consumer movement, which gave rise to lobbies like the National Consumers League and Consumers Union as well as ill-fated legislation to create a federal Consumer Protection Agency.},

Author Stephen Grant Meyer offers the first full length national history of American race relations examined through the lens of housing discrimination, and he forces readers to confront and re-evaluate the deep and enduring division between the races. Although this is a discomforting analysis, which concludes that housing discrimination still exists, it is only a clearer understanding of our shared racial past that will enable Americans to create a successful prescription for fighting intolerance. An original and captivating study that illuminates overlooked groups and individuals committed to the national struggle for civil rights, this is important reading for anyone interested in African-American history.},

@book{WoodwardStrangeCareerJim2001,

  isbn = {978-0-19-972861-9},
  abstract = {C. Vann Woodward, who died in 1999 at the age of 91, was America's most eminent Southern historian, the winner of a Pulitzer Prize for Mary Chestnut's Civil War and a Bancroft Prize for The Origins of the New South. Now, to honor his long and truly distinguished career, Oxford is pleased to publish this special commemorative edition of Woodward's most influential work, The Strange Career of Jim Crow. The Strange Career of Jim Crow is one of the great works of Southern history. Indeed, the book actually helped shape that history. Published in 1955, a year after the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education ordered schools desegregated, Strange Career was cited so often to counter arguments for segregation that Martin Luther King, Jr. called it "the historical Bible of the civil rights movement." The book offers a clear and illuminating analysis of the history of Jim Crow laws, presenting evidence that segregation in the South dated only to the 1890s. Woodward convincingly shows that, even under slavery, the two races had not been divided as they were under the Jim Crow laws of the 1890s. In fact, during Reconstruction, there was considerable economic and political mixing of the races. The segregating of the races was a relative newcomer to the region. Hailed as one of the top 100 nonfiction works of the twentieth century, The Strange Career of Jim Crow has sold almost a million copies and remains, in the words of David Herbert Donald, "a landmark in the history of American race relations."},
