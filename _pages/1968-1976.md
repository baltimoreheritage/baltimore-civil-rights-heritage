Patterson from Seattle in July 1971. Later, Mayor Schaefer appointed the first black police commissioner in 1984. [@sartain_borders_2013, 171]

### Gender

The growth of the feminist movement at a national level brought new opportunities for African American women in Baltimore during this period and focused attention on sexism within the Civil Rights movement and racism within the feminist movement.

- In **1966**: the National Organization for Women (NOW) organized in Washington, DC
- ** October 13, 1967**: President Lyndon B. Johnson issues [Executive Order 11375](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11375) forbidding sex discrimination in businesses working with the government.
- **1972**: Congress passed [Title IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX) of the [1972 Educational Amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Amendments_of_1972) to the Civil Rights Act to enforce sex equality in education, (forcing educational institutions to support women's sports).
- **1973**: National Black Feminist Organization formed in New York
- **January 22, 1973**: Supreme Court strikes down many state abortion laws with the [Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade) decision.

**Note**: These examples are all national – this section needs more local examples and context for Baltimore.

### Shift to community development issues

**The Activists organize to fight housing discrimination - 1969**

In 1969, a coalition of black and white civil rights advocates, including chairman Sampson Green, an African-American attorney, member of the Maryland Human Relations Commission, and housing committee chairman, and John J. Martinez, white Jesuit teacher at St. Bernadine’s, organized The Activists—an interracial fair housing organization. The group targeted the Morris Goldseker Company with protests outside its downtown offices highlighting its role as “block-busters.” Operating under a variety of names, the Goldseker-related realty companies doubled the mark-up on house sales in Edmondson Village in comparison to other areas. The Activists described how companies purchased houses for an average of $7,320 and sold them for an average of $12,387, a markup of 69%, with the inescapable conclusion that, “The dollar in the hands of the white man buys more than the dollar in the hands of the black man.”[@orser_blockbusting_1994]
