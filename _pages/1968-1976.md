## Introduction

This period opened with the unrest following the assassination of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Baltimore and in cities across the country. At the national and the local level, the many residents and elected officials saw the 1968 unrest as a wake up call of the urgent need for more aggressive action on Civil Rights. However, others used the unrest to pursue a reactionary agenda opposed to Civil Rights.

Major themes in this period include:

- The changing leadership and organization of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore.
- The increasing prominence of gender and feminism within the movement and the intersection between the Civil Rights movement and social movements for disability rights, LGBTQ rights, and others.
- The shift by many prominent Civil Rights groups from a focus on segregation and discrimination to the need to address the legacy of those factors through community development.
- The failure of the city to address school segregation.
- Arts and culture

## Associated Places

Some actors within the Civil Rights movement in this period only attached to specific buildings on a temporary or fleeting basis. For example, the Baltimore Branch of the Black Panther Party organized in 1969 and shut down the organization in 1972. In that three year period, the members of the branch organized classes, community support activities, and held protest actions at dozens of different buildings and locations. <!-- Note: The BPP began organizing locally in 1968 --> The chapter initially operated out of a house at E. Eager Street and Homewood Avenue, offered free breakfast and lunch programs out of churches in East and West Baltimore including "St .Vincent's D. Poore's church in East Baltimore at Valley and Eager Street"[@mccutchen_black_2004] (the former
St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church which closed in 1966), and, by 1970, established a "Black Community Information Center" at 1248 N. Gay Street.

### Symbolic meaning

Similar trends can be seen in the celebration of "soul food" restaurants such as The Yellow Bowl and the (restaurant in southwest Baltimore maybe on Baltimore Street).

- Madison Park historic district
- Negro War Heroes Monument

Examples include a 1969 picket at Roth's Market <!-- FIXME: Add the location of the market and the reason for the protest. -->

### Public housing

Public and low-income housing, both existing and new, served as an important site of organizing and of conflict during the late 1960s and 1970s. Tenants' rights groups organized among residents at Fairfield, Lafayette Courts, and Murphy Homes, among others. (see p. 176)

Low-income Housing on 1300 block of Madison Avenue:

>The Reverend Bascom, pastor of Douglass Memorial Community Church, purchased the entire 1300 block of Madison Avenue with church funds, renovated the buildings, and converted them to low-income housing. This development reflects the transition of the Civil Rights movement towards a renewed focus on community and economic development in the 1960s and 1970s.

### Changing leadership and organization of the Civil Rights movement

The people and organizations that supported Civil Rights activism in Baltimore experienced major changes in the late 1960s and 1970s. These changes reflected broader changes in the movement driven, in part, by the new access black residents and activists had to formal institutions.

One notable example of these changes is the 1969 election of Enolia McMillan as president of the Baltimore Branch of the NAACP. McMillan's election won an upset victory over Juanita Jackson Mitchell, who sought the post after her mother, Lillie M. Jackson, stepped down after serving thirty four years as president of the group.[@brewington_enolia_2006] [Dr. Furman Templeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_L._Templeton), the executive director of the Baltimore Urban League since 1950, died on February 12, 1970 marking another major transition.

New organizations emerged such as the Soul School and Mother Rescuers. The Black Panthers, established in Oakland in October 1966, had established a Baltimore Chapter by 1968 but suffered from internal divisions and surveillance and harassment from the  from federal and local police. This is exemplified by the arrest of  Marshall "Eddie" Conway on April 23, 1970.

African American Baltimoreans found new opportunities in private businesses. In 1968, Maryland National (Baltimore's largest bank) appointed E. Thomas Williams as the bank's first black manager.[@jones_black_1976]

These changes also affected public workers. By 1971, African American workers held 46% of the 41,000 municipal jobs in Baltimore City including some key leadership positions. For example, in July 1971, Ronald N. Patterson, previously a resident of Seattle, came to Baltimore to serve as the first black school superintendent.[@sartain_borders_2013, 171] That same year, a group of African American Baltimore City police officers founded their own organization the Vanguard Justice Society. <!-- TODO: What was the purpose of this organization? Who were the members? -->

On January 3, 1971, Parren Mitchell took office as the first black member of the U.S. Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction. Mitchell had experience advocating for Civil Rights within and outside of government. From 1963 to 1965 he was executive secretary of the Maryland Human Relations Commission, overseeing implementation of the state's public accommodations law. Mitchell then became director of the Baltimore Community Action Agency, an anti-poverty program, from 1965 to 1968, when he resigned and returned to Morgan State as a professor of sociology and assistant director of its Urban Affairs Institute. In 1969, he became the President of Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. where he continued through 1970. Parren Mitchell was elected as a Democrat in 1970 served seven succeeding terms in Congress from January 3, 1971 through January 3, 1987.

 <!-- Later, Mayor Schaefer appointed the first black police commissioner in 1984. -->

## Gender

The growth of the feminist movement at a national level brought new opportunities for African American women in Baltimore during this period and focused attention on sexism within the Civil Rights movement and racism within the feminist movement.

The late 1960s and early 1970s saw major changes for national policies affecting women. On October 13, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued [Executive Order 11375](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11375) forbidding sex discrimination in businesses working with the government. In 1972, Congress passed [Title IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX) of the [1972 Educational Amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Amendments_of_1972) to the Civil Rights Act to enforce sex equality in education (forcing educational institutions to support women's sports).  On January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down many state abortion laws with the _[Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roev.Wade)_ decision.

Activists also organized at the national level as in 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) organized in Washington, DC and, in 1973, the National Black Feminist Organization formed in New York.

>In the 1960s, PPM began providing education and training services in addition to direct health care. Clinics were opened in churches and universities; chapters were founded in other communities; education centers flourished in nearly every county in the state. Federal and state funding reached an all-time high in the 70s, only to be cut drastically in the next decade by President Ronald Reagan. PPM throughout this time maintained a strong history of growth and stability.

## Shift to community development issues

The shift of Baltimore's Civil Rights movement to focus on community development was an evolution, not a revolution, from the work of prior decades. After all, affordable housing and public health for African Americans had emerged and remained major concerns for local activists throughout the twentieth century. However, in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, activists now had new resources from the city and the federal government to pursue community goals. In addition, many hoped to learn from the failure of "urban renewal" programs in Harlem Park and other neighborhoods in the 1940s and 1950s and shift to an approach where community residents and community-based organizations took on more prominent leadership roles in the process.

Echoing later community development efforts activists pursued both an "inside" and "outside" game. The "inside" game work in historically segregated black neighborhoods to do work including:

- Expanding access to culture, arts, and recreation (e.g. Operation CHAMP; Eubie Blake Cultural Center)
- Job training and business development
- Affordable housing development (especially in partnership with churches, e.g. St. James Terrace; N.M. Carroll Apartments)

The outside game focused on:

- Housing segregation and discrimination (especially in Baltimore County or historically segrgeated white neighborhoods)
- Hiring policies for white-owned businesses

These efforts are exemplified by nonprofit groups like the Druid Heights Community Development Corporation (established 1974) and Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development (BUILD) (founded 1977); and by new city and state agencies such as the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture (MCAAHC) (established 1969).

<!-- TODO: Figure out if this is at all related. "1975 as Southeast Development, Inc. (SDI), it was the development arm of the Southeast Community Organization (SECO)" http://www.southeastcdc.org/who-we-are/mission/ -->
<!-- TODO: FIgure out role for unions and labor groups. https://1199seiu.org/history + "Property service workers first organized in the Washington D.C. area in the early 1940s, and we were on the front lines in the movement to unionize thousands of commercial janitors and cleaners throughout the U.S." http://www.seiu32bj.org/districts/dc-va-md/ -->

Ultimately, these efforts in Baltimore contributed to a national effort to change federal policy. For example, the [Equal Credit Opportunity Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Credit_Opportunity_Act) was approved in 1974 to make it against the law for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant by race, gender. In 1977, the [Community Reinvestment Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Reinvestment_Act) passed.

### Housing segregation and discrimination

In 1969, a coalition of black and white civil rights advocates, including chairman Sampson Green, an African-American attorney, member of the Maryland Human Relations Commission, and housing committee chairman, and John J. Martinez, white Jesuit teacher at St. Bernadine's, organized The Activistsâ€”an interracial fair housing organization. The group targeted the Morris Goldseker Company with protests outside its downtown offices highlighting its role as "block-busters." Operating under a variety of names, the Goldseker-related realty companies doubled the mark-up on house sales in Edmondson Village in comparison to other areas. The Activists described how companies purchased houses for an average of $7,320 and sold them for an average of $12,387, a markup of 69%, with the inescapable conclusion that, "The dollar in the hands of the white man buys more than the dollar in the hands of the black man."[@orser_blockbusting_1994]

In August 1970, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission holds hearing on suburban development in Baltimore County.
