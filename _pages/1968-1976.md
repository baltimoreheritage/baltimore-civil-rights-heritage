The final period in this context study begins the week of unrest in April 1968 following the assassination of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Some Baltimore residents and elected officials saw the 1968 unrest as a wake up call sounding an urgent demand for aggressive action on Civil Rights. However, others used the unrest as the pretext to pursue a reactionary agenda opposing expanded opportunities for black Baltimoreans. While activists had succeeded in overturning many of the city, state, and federal policies that enforced racial segregation and discrimination, the legacy of these policies continued to have major consequences for black Baltimoreans and the development of segregated black neighborhoods. Activist efforts to shift the debate over Civil Rights to focus on community development, however, were stymied by the apathy of white elected officials at the local level and antipathy of federal officials, such as President Richard Nixon who drastically cut funding for the "War on Poverty" programs established under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Moreover, the much-celebrated "peaceful" desegregation of Baltimore's public schools proved completely inadequate to the challenges of a region where housing grew even more segregated in the 1960s and 1970s and school and city leadership refused to enact policy changes to address the issue. This introduction continues to describe the consequences of the April 1968 unrest, the political landscape for Civil Rights at the federal and local level, and changes in population across the region.

On Thursday, April 4, 1968, [Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Martin_Luther_King_Jr.) in Memphis, Tennessee. The following day, unrest broke out in Detroit and Washington, D.C. In Baltimore, three hundred people gathered for a peaceful memorial service on the morning of Saturday, April 6. That afternoon, however, residents began to attack properties in East Baltimore and fires broke out at multiple locations. The unrest spread quickly and continued through Thursday, April 11.

On Tuesday, April 9, 1968, Maryland Governor [Spiro Agnew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Agnew) invited one hundred of Baltimore's black leaders to meet at the State Center Office Building. Agnew used the meeting to deliver a one-sided lecture charging the participants with "responsibility for the riots". Most of those in attendance walked out. Some drafted an "angry rebuttal" observing, "Agnew's actions are more in keeping with the slave system of a bygone era." They noted that by separating "good" moderates from "bad" militants (what Agnew called the "circuit-riding, Hanoi-visiting type of leader"), Governor Agnew sought to divide black activists from one another. One minister observed: "He's forcing us all to become militants."[@baum_how_2011, 160] In a vivid example of the divisions among local residents, however, hundreds of white Baltimoreans sent telegraphs to Agnew's office—most to praise his attack on Baltimore's black leaders. One stated: "Thankful to hear that the white people still have a strong voice in government."[@baum_how_2011, 161]

By the end of the week, it was clear to everyone that the unrest had left thousands of residents reeling from the damage. Police arrested 5,512 people (nearly all of them black; totaling about one in every seventy-five black residents). At the height, 12,000 troops had occupied the city (one for every seventy-five Baltimore residents). Six hundred people were injured (fifty police officers among them). The city saw 1,208 major fires and 1,049 businesses damaged. Six people were killed.[@baum_how_2011, 160]

While the factors that shaped the Civil Rights movement and the politics of race predated the 1968 unrest, the unrest delivered a new way of understanding the uncertain future of the movement and Baltimore's segregated African American neighborhoods. Over the next decade, the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore was shaped by both a renewed progressive vision for reinvestment in historically segregated black neighborhoods and a reactionary withdrawal continuing the pattern of "white flight" that followed World War II.

This local conflict took place in a national context of an aggressive reaction against the Civil Rights movement. The [1968 Republican National Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Republican_National_Convention) illustrated these reversals when Agnew's patronizing lecture of Baltimore's black activists won him the nomination as Richard Nixon's Vice-President. The selection reinforced the Republican party's [southern strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) to win the support of conservative white voters inspired to racist reaction by the Civil Rights policies of incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Democratic Party. Following Nixon's reelection in 1972, his administration made sharp cuts to funding for urban areas and War on Poverty programs with lasting consequences for urban renewal and transportation projects in Baltimore's historically segregated black neighborhoods. <!-- NOTE: Citation missing! -->

At the local and state level, political leaders were not always antagonistic to Civil Rights activists but often apathetic and indifferent. [Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_L._J._D%27Alesandro_III), who had won office in 1967 as a strong supporter of the Civil Rights movement, opted not to run for a second term. Mayor [William Donald Schaefer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Donald_Schaefer) took office in 1971, beginning a sixteen year period as Mayor, but took a largely passive role on Civil Rights issues during his term in office. [Marvin Mandel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Mandel) became Governor in 1969 after Agnew's resignation to serve as Vice President. While praised for his appointment of black judges and relationships with black business leaders (including William Adams, Henry Parks Jr. and Raymond Haysbert of the Park Sausage Company), Mandel similarly avoided taking strong positions on Civil Rights issues.[@williams_jr._mandels_2015] For example, both Mayor Schaefer and Governor Mandel continued to support Baltimore City Police Commisioner [Donald Pommerlau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Pomerleau) even after a Maryland State Senate investigation in 1976 revealed that over the previous decade Pommerlau had created the Inspectional Services Division (ISD) and spied on Civil Rights activists, including Congressional Representative Parren Mitchell. <!-- NOTE: Citation missing! -->  <!--  Revelations such as the ISD and the instability of local leadership (the Baltimore City School board, for example, went through a large number of directors in this period) led to a broad loss of trust in public institutions and elected officials among many Baltimore residents. NOTE: Citation missing! -->

Baltimore's City Council was a lone bright spot for Civil Rights activists. A contested redistricting process in early 1971 led to more opportunities for black candidates to win election to the City Council.[@price_3rd_bard_1971; @price_3rd_negro_1971; @price_3rd_districting_1971] By October, anticipating the election based on the results of the Democratic primary, the *Sun* reported:

> The Baltimore City Council, an exclusively Democratic province since before World War II, seem likely to be controlled for the first time by a coalition of liberal whites and Negroes no matter what the outcome of the general election.[@_negro-white_1971]

During this period, Baltimore City experienced a precipitous decline in total population and African American residents became a growing share of the total. Between 1970 and 1980, Baltimore City lost over 110,000 residents and African American residents became a majority of the city's population. Despite the overall decline in population, the period saw the construction of many new school buildings and recreation centers as the city replaced what many saw as aging, out-dated facilities.

Thousands of white Baltimoreans moved out to the surrounding suburbs, as the area including Anne Arundel County, Baltimore County, Carroll County, Harford County, Howard County, and Queen Anne's County grew rapidly.

 <!-- NOTE: What happened to poverty and employment in this period? How does the city deal with job loss and revenue loss? -->

The following sections address several themes in more detail including:

- The changing leadership and organization of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore. This theme includes both the black power movement; the increasing prominence of gender and feminism within the movement; and the intersection between the Civil Rights movement and social movements for disability rights, LGBTQ rights, and others.
- The shift by Civil Rights activists to focus on community development to address the legacy of segregation and discrimination. This theme is shaped by competing efforts to encourage reinvestment in historically segregated neighborhoods and the withdrawal of white residents and white-controlled businesses and institutions from those same neighborhoods.
- The failure of government and community efforts to address school and housing segregation.
- New approaches to protesting police violence and the impact of police surveillance on Civil Rights activism during this period.
- The early success of activists seeking to address issues of representation among arts and cultural organizations. This theme is seen in public art, monuments, and the preservation of historic places associated with African Americans in Baltimore.

## Associated Places

<!-- NOTE: What places were demolished in this period? How were black communities in Baltimore County affected by the development of I-695 and other suburban projects? -->

The places associated with the Civil Rights movement in this period include private homes adopted by radical activist organizations, unassuming buildings put to use for community organizing by city agencies, and new buildings erected in an effort to promote economic opportunity for black Baltimoreans. In contrast to earlier periods, where buildings such as churches or homes for activists developed long-term associations with the Civil Rights movement, many of these buildings were only associated with the movement for a brief period. In addition, the expanding scope of demolition under continuing "urban renewal" efforts in this period led to the loss of a number of significant structures. Another novel aspect of this period is the emerging importance of preservation and public history in preserving and interpreting buildings associated with African American history. 

Examples of buildings associated with Civil Rights activist groups include the numerous structures used by the Baltimore Branch of the Black Panther Party between the earliest organization of the chapter in 1968 and group's end in 1972. In that short period, the group organized classes, community support activities, and protests at dozens of different buildings and locations. The group initially grew out of the Soul School located at 522 North Fremont Street near the George P. Murphy Homes. The first formal chapter headquarters was a house at 1209 North Eden Street and the members began organizing free breakfast and lunch programs at nearby St .Vincent's D. Poore's Church (formerly St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church; in 2017, occupied as Sweet Prospect Baptist Church). By 1970, the headquarters (also referenced as a "Black Community Information Center") had moved to a rented house at 1248 N. Gay Street.[@holter_vanguard_2017, 42, 59, 128; @mccutchen_black_2004] 

Other buildings are associated with public agencies, such as the Community Action Agency, the Model Cities Agency and the Baltimore Urban Services Agency, all directed by Lenwood Ivey, and their effort to connect to the needs of Baltimore residents by bringing services out into city neighborhoods.[@faust_neighborhood_2015, 55] Aiden Faust describes the network of twenty-three neighborhood centers writing:

> These centers were distributed across the city, with higher concentrations in East and West Baltimore, where the poorest neighborhoods were (and still are) concentrated. The centers occupied repurposed churches, storefronts, libraries, public baths, or (in the case of Dunbar) associated with an existing public high school. These diverse settings served as multipurpose centers for many programs and classes for children, teens, senior citizens, young mothers, the homeless, and families in crisis. Food pantries, yoga classes, poetry readings, dance performances, legal assistance, home heating assistance, library services, and many more programmatic offerings coexisted in these spaces.[@faust_neighborhood_2015, 55-56]

In addition to these neighborhood centers, Model Cities established six "Community Councils" which became seen as "centers of black political activity" and were "eyed with concern by City Councilmen and the local media." Consequently, in 1976, Lenwood Ivey shut down the Community Councils, a controversial decision that was "decidedly unpopular with residents and Council staff."[@faust_neighborhood_2015, 58]

The shifting expectations of how Civil Rights activism took shape also affected some of the places with long-established associations with the Civil Rights movement, such as in June 1968,  when Rev. Walter L. Hildebrand, the new pastor at Bethel AME Church, affirmed the church's plans to make the church "of utmost service to the poor, the hopeless and the oppressed."[@oliver_new_1968]

Public buildings could be sites of conflict in other ways. For example, in August 1968, the Upton Planning Committee threatened a boycott of Lafayette Market (now known as the Avenue Market) on Pennsylvania Avenue in a successful effort to force improvements in the conditions of the market.[@_boycott_1968]

Civil Rights organizing also took place in buildings associated with the peace movement and other radical political and social movements. One example is the Peace Action Center at 2525 Maryland Street described by Amy E. Zanoni as the "locus for the city’s antiwar movement". The provided office and meeting space for the Baltimore Defense Committee and *Peace and Freedom News*, "Baltimore’s first underground newspaper", along with a mimeograph machine and a paid full-time staff person, Gren Whitman, whose salary was funded by a "progressive peace tax paid by the BDC’s members".[@zanoni_working_2013, 34, 69]

Businesses and institutions also responded to the currents of Civil Rights activism. One notable example the business established by Charles Thurgood Burns (1915-1991) in 1970 when he took over the bankrupt “Super Jet Market” located on East Chase Street. Renaming the business Super Pride, he restored the business to profitability within three years—despite encountering some food companies that refused to work with a black-owned store. Burns had started in the grocery business around 1921 delivering groceries for the small store his grandfather owned on Dolphin Street. He sold vegetables, produce and fish out of the back of a cart during high school and college then later became the co-owner of Hilton Court Chain of Ethical Pharmacies – a business that according to Burns’ obituary, “catered to the needs of black consumers at a time when white-owned businesses ignored them.”[@robinson_charles_1991] Between 1970 and 1990, Super Pride grew to seven locations, employing more than 400 people, and making over $43 million in annual sales. Under Burns’ leadership, Super Pride sponsored Black History Month activities and supported the Arena Players. By the late 1990s, however, the business struggled to compete against national chains and the city’s shrinking population. In the fall of 2000, Super Pride closed all eight of its locations and, in November, held an auction to liquidate the stores and their remaining equipment to satisfy creditors.[@sentementes_super_2000]

Other black-owned businesses found success in marketing traditional southern cooking as "soul food" among including Sampson's located at 944 W. Fayette Street, the Red Rooster Restaurant and Lounge at 1801 McKean Avenue, and The Yellow Bowl on Greenmount Avenue.

Another example is found in a March 1971 *Sun* profile of pharmacist Donald A. Schumer and his investment in a new building at Pennsylvania Avenue and Dolphin Street for the forty-year-old Penn-Dol Pharmacy.^[As of 2017, the building at 1133 Pennsylvania Avenue is occupied by Best Care Pharmacy]. The report noted Schumer's sale of the the store's "sundries section to several black employees who had been with him for a number of years" and observed, "The interior of the pharmacy resembles the orderly kind of drug store one expects to find in the affluent white suburbs."[@_white_1971]

In this same period, a large number of buildings associated with African American history in Baltimore were demolished to make way for transportation and "urban renewal projects". Between 1973 and 1977, nine hundred and seventy one rowhouses and sixty-two businesses came down to make way for the partial construction of the East-West Expressway.[@dilts_3-road_1973] Hundreds more fell for the construction of Martin Luther King Boulevard beginning in 1976.[@dilts_residents_1975] In 1971, the city tore down the much-beloved Royal Theatre on Pennsylvania Avenue. One 1986 account, recalled the Royal as "the brightest gem along the cultural and business strip that made Pennsylvania Avenue the nucleus of Baltimore's black community from the 1920s through the 1960s". The author attributed the theatre's decline to both the integration of other theatres in Baltimore in the 1960s and the competition from the opening of the Civic Centre (now the Baltimore Arena) in 1962. [@giuliano_royal_1986]

This trend saw resistance both from anti-highway activists and from black Baltimoreans seeking to preserve historic places associated with African American history in Baltimore. In some cases, they found allies with the Baltimore Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation (CHAP) established in 1964, the Maryland Historical Trust (MHT) established in 1966, and the Commission on Negro History and Culture (later renamed the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture (MCAAHC)) established in 1969.

<!-- NOTE: This section could mention the A.B. Koger Resource Library, headquarters of the Commission on the Study of Negro History and Culture, 12 W. Madison Street. In 1972, moved to Morgan State. -->

The most prominent of these early efforts was the Committee for the Preservation of Orchard Street Church, organized in the fall of 1972 and led by Mrs. W.A.C. Hughes.[@_historic_1972; @_old_1973; @pietila_black_1974; @arnett_church_1976] The National Register of Historic Places provided an important tool for recognizing and protecting African American landmarks including Orchard Street United Methodist Church (designated November 12, 1975), Public School No. 111 at N. Carrollton Avenue and Riggs Road (designated September 25, 1979), Cummins Memorial Church (1210 W. Lanvale Street)  (designated October 31, 1979), and the Sharp Street Memorial United Methodist Church and Community House (designated July 21, 1982). Cleary, these efforts do not end in 1976 but continue up through the present. In the 1970s, CHAP designated several local landmarks associated with African American history in Baltimore including Bethel A.M.E. Church and Ebenezer A.M.E. Church in 1971 and Sharon Baptist Church (1373 N. Stricker Street) and First Baptist Church (525 N. Caroline Street) in 1977. CHAP designated Madison Park as the city's first historic district occupied largely by African American residents also in 1977.

{% include figure image_path="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4249/34649587930_aa889fb313_b.jpg" alt="Front view of First Baptist Church facing towards the northeast." caption="CHAP designed First Baptist Church (1880) at 525 N. Caroline Street as a local landmark in 1977. Photograph by Eli Pousson, 2017 June 1. Courtesy Baltimore Heritage ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/))." %}

Other cultural organizations also changed to reflect rising black political and social power. One example is the Negro War Heroes Monument commissioned in 1968 and installed at Monument Square on Calvert Street, despite some opposition, in 1971.[@keidel_monument_1968; @_protests_1971] Another example is found at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, Branch 17 (known at present as the Pennsylvania Avenue Branch library) where librarians organized a program on Langston Hughes in the summer of 1969:

> The biggest attractions at Branch 17 are books on job opportunities and books about Negro history and culture. Miss Lillie Story, administrative assistant at the branch, said that the big increase in demand for the latter books has come since the 1968 Baltimore riots.[@arnett_evening_1969]

## Changing leadership and organization of the Civil Rights movement

<!-- NOTE: How were black and white Baltimore residents effected by the Civil Rights movement and related issues? How about in the suburbs? -->

To a remarkable degree, this period is marked by radical changes in the structure and aims of the Civil Rights movement. The huge legislative and judicial accomplishments of the movement between 1954 and 1968, along with the identification of the movement with some of the most visisble and memorable figures, sometimes leads people to assume that the movement ended in 1968.

 While the movement did not end, this period resulted in major transformations among the individual leadership and the organizational structure. The movement also helped to inspire a wide range of related social movement that, in turn, shaped local and national history in major ways. These related movements, including feminism, LGBTQ rights, [disability rights]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_rights_movement), and Native rights, had, of course, been present for decades but were accorded much greater visisibility in this period.

<!-- NOTE: Has anyone already researched the history of the disability rights movement or Native rights movement in Baltimore or Maryland? -->

### Changing individual leadership

The people and organizations that supported Civil Rights activism in Baltimore experienced major changes in the late 1960s and 1970s. These changes reflected broader changes in the movement driven, in part, by the new access black residents and activists had to formal institutions.

One notable example of these changes is the 1969 election of Enolia McMillan as president of the Baltimore Branch of the NAACP. McMillan's election won an upset victory over Juanita Jackson Mitchell, who sought the post after her mother, Lillie M. Jackson, stepped down after serving thirty four years as president of the group.[@brewington_enolia_2006]

This period was marked by the passing of an earlier generation of local Civil Rights leaders, many of whom remained active in local politics up until their death. [Dr. Furman Templeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_L._Templeton), the executive director of the Baltimore Urban League since 1950, died on February 12, 1970.[@_dr._1970]  Physician and long-time activist Dr. John Camper died on Nov 21, 1977.[@_physician_1977]

African American Baltimoreans found new opportunities in private businesses. In 1968, Maryland National (Baltimore's largest bank) appointed E. Thomas Williams as the bank's first black manager.[@jones_black_1976]

Oher prominent activists and organizers in this period included Walter Percival Carter (1923 - d. July 31, 1971).[@_rites_1971] Aiden Faust describes Carter's significant legacy writing:

> Walter Percival Carter was a social worker and civil rights activist who led Baltimore’s chapter of the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE), organized voter registration drives and freedom rides, served as Maryland's coordinator for the 1963 March on Washington, and was involved with protests to desegregate employment at Baltimore Gas and Electric, Gwynn Oak amusement park, and Howard Johnson hotels.[@faust_neighborhood_2015, 38-39]

As the chief community organizer for Baltimore's Model Cities agency, Carter shows how many activists transitioned in this period to work within local and state government rather than solely on the outside. These changes affected not only activists but other black Baltimoreans as well. By 1971, African American workers held 46% of the 41,000 municipal jobs in Baltimore City including some key leadership positions. <!-- NOTE: Citation missing! -->

Linwood Ivey is another example of a public employee and administrator whose work sought to serve the broader goals of the Civil Rights movement. Originally appointed as the director of the Community Action Agency (CAA), Ivey continued to lead the succeeeding Model City Agency (MCA), and the Ubran Services Agency (USA).[@faust_neighborhood_2015, 55]

In July 1971, Ronald N. Patterson, previously a resident of Seattle, came to Baltimore to serve as the first black school superintendent.[@sartain_borders_2013, 171]

<!-- NOTE: That same year, a group of African American Baltimore City police officers founded their own organization the Vanguard Justice Society. What was the purpose of this organization? Who were the members? In 1984, Mayor Schaefer appointed the first black police commissioner. -->

Others went from public workers to hold elected office. Charles Blount, a former principal at Dunbar High School, served on the Community Action Commission in 1968 and won election to the Maryland State Senate in 1971. Later, in 1985, Blount resigned from the board of the Urban Services Agency to protest the regressive cuts and policy changes affecting the organization.[@faust_neighborhood_2015, 67]

On January 3, 1971, Parren Mitchell took office as the first black member of the U.S. Congress from a Southern state since Reconstruction. Mitchell had experience advocating for Civil Rights within and outside of government. From 1963 to 1965 he was executive secretary of the Maryland Human Relations Commission, overseeing implementation of the state's public accommodations law. Mitchell then became director of the Baltimore Community Action Agency, an anti-poverty program, from 1965 to 1968, when he resigned and returned to Morgan State as a professor of sociology and assistant director of its Urban Affairs Institute. In 1969, he became the President of Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. where he continued through 1970. Parren Mitchell was elected as a Democrat in 1970 served seven succeeding terms in Congress from January 3, 1971 through January 3, 1987.

White activists and allies also played a significant role in this period. Walter Sondheim, for example, was hailed as a "civic leader" for his management of the desegration of Baltimore's public schools and downtown urban renewal efforts.[@dorsey_prolific_1975]

### Changing organizations

In many of the neighborhoods where African American households were buying homes they could never have purchased a decade earlier, black middle-income residents<!-- NOTE: What proporition of this new cohort of residents were middle v. low-income? Who participated in resident organizing in the 1950s? --> organized a new set of community groups that played an important role in local debates over school segregation, housing, and community development policy. One example of this type of organization is the Evergreen Protective Association representing a neighborhood located within the Edmondson Avenue National Register Historic District. The organization made a lifetime membership donation to the NAACP in the early 1960s. Their commitment to civil rights activism included providing “sandwiches, coffee and milk” along with the League of Women Voters and the Dunbar PTA, to students from Dunbar High School engaged in a sit-in at the Baltimore Department of Education in the spring of 1964.<!-- Citation missing! -->

U-JOIN:

> A significant aspect of this move toward addressing structural problems entailed the formation of student groups like Baltimore’s U-JOIN, headed by Lively, and CORE, which engaged in anti-poverty activism, understanding it as central to anti-racist struggles, in the early 1960s. U-JOIN was founded by members of Baltimore SDS as part of its Emergency Rehabilitation Assistance Project (ERAP) and included students from Hopkins, Goucher, and Morgan, as well as non-students and people that dropped out of school to fight for social justice. ERAP, according to Rhonda Williams, was "hoping to build an ‘interracial movement’ by galvanizing poor people at the grass roots around issues such as housing, schools, medical care, and food insecurity."[@zanoni_working_2013, 55]

Paul Coates on the Black Panther Party in Baltimore (early 1969 to late 1972):

> I thought that the party was doing things that would have an impact on the lives of black people. It seemed like a good vehicle. When I came in, I had only a limited basis for understanding the world. I just knew it was fucked up. But I had no perspective, no point of view. No process for sorting out the significance of the things I was seeing and experiencing, no process for validating my views against those of other people. In the party I began to develop my own system of political understanding. The party had a structure in place to encourage political education. He provided a setting where I could interact with people who are searching for answers, and with some who thought they knew the answers.[@mcdougall_black_1993, 59]

White allies of the Black Panther Party; Baltimore Committee for Political Freedom "formed because of fear that the local police were planning to assassinate Black Panther Party leaders in the city"; membership included[@mcdougall_black_1993, 58]:

- Dr. Peter Rossi, Social Relations Department of Johns Hopkins University
- William Zinman, attorney for the Maryland ACLU
- Rev. Chester Wickwire, white minister

New organizations emerged such as the Soul School and Mother Rescuers. The Black Panthers, established in Oakland in October 1966, had established a Baltimore Chapter by 1968 but suffered from internal divisions and surveillance and harassment from the  from federal and local police. This is exemplified by the arrest of  Marshall "Eddie" Conway on April 23, 1970.[@conway_marshall_2011]

### Civil Rights movement and feminism

The growth of the feminist movement at a national level brought new opportunities for African American women in Baltimore during this period and focused attention on sexism within the Civil Rights movement and racism within the feminist movement.

The late 1960s and early 1970s saw major changes for national policies affecting women. On October 13, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued [Executive Order 11375](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11375) forbidding sex discrimination in businesses working with the government. In 1972, Congress passed [Title IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX) of the [1972 Educational Amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Amendments_of_1972) to the Civil Rights Act to enforce sex equality in education (forcing educational institutions to support women's sports).  On January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down many state abortion laws with the _[Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roev.Wade)_ decision.

Activists also organized at the national level as in 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) organized in Washington, DC and, in 1973, the National Black Feminist Organization formed in New York.

> In the 1960s, PPM began providing education and training services in addition to direct health care. Clinics were opened in churches and universities; chapters were founded in other communities; education centers flourished in nearly every county in the state. Federal and state funding reached an all-time high in the 70s, only to be cut drastically in the next decade by President Ronald Reagan. PPM throughout this time maintained a strong history of growth and stability.

## Shift to community development issues

The shift of Baltimore's Civil Rights movement to focus on community development was an evolution, not a revolution, from the work of prior decades. After all, affordable housing and public health for African Americans had emerged and remained major concerns for local activists throughout the twentieth century. However, in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, activists now had new resources from the city and the federal government to pursue community goals. In addition, many hoped to learn from the failure of "urban renewal" programs in Harlem Park and other neighborhoods in the 1940s and 1950s and shift to an approach where community residents and community-based organizations took on more prominent leadership roles in the process.

Echoing later community development efforts activists pursued both an "inside" and "outside" game. The "inside" game work in historically segregated black neighborhoods to do work including:

- Expanding access to culture, arts, and recreation (e.g. Operation CHAMP; Eubie Blake Cultural Center)
- Job training and business development
- Affordable housing development (especially in partnership with churches, e.g. St. James Terrace; N.M. Carroll Apartments)

The outside game focused on:

- Housing segregation and discrimination (especially in Baltimore County or historically segrgeated white neighborhoods)
- Hiring policies for white-owned businesses

These efforts are exemplified by nonprofit groups like the Druid Heights Community Development Corporation (established 1974) and Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development (BUILD) (founded 1977).

Ultimately, these efforts in Baltimore contributed to a national effort to change federal policy. For example, the [Equal Credit Opportunity Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Credit_Opportunity_Act) was approved in 1974 to make it against the law for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant by race, gender. In 1977, the [Community Reinvestment Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Reinvestment_Act) passed.

### Urban renewal in Upton

3.2 million spent so far on Upton, March 18, 1973:

### Anti-poverty efforts

By late 1969, as the Baltimore Welfare Rights Organization (BWRO) began to grow, Governor Marvin Mandel (then still serving out the remainder of Spiro Agnew's term after Agnew became Vice-President) moved to abolish the State Board of Social Services as part of a broader plan to move state agencies from a board to a secretary system. Historian Rhonda Williams quotes Barbara Stevenson, the only welfare recipient and woman on the nine-member board, who described the abolition of the board as an "assault on the poor both black and white", as a possible "means to stop demonstrations and protests" and as an effort to stymie "rapport built with welfare rights' organizations and other groups."[@williams_living_1998, 288-289]

Historian Rhonda Williams describes a campaign from 1966 to 1978 that put the welfare department, housing authority, and city officials "on notice" by:

> calling attention to its commitment to business and revitalization while ignoring or heaping the burden on the backs of poor people."[@williams_living_1998, 304]

Historian Rhonda Williams quotes the "battle cry" issued in 1969 by the [National Welfare Rights Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Welfare_Rights_Organization) (NWRO) and adopted by local activists:

> We are not willing to sell our rights as American citizens, our rights to dignity, our rights to justice, our rights to democracy, for the food, clothing and shelter which our age, our disability, the absence or death of our family’s breadwinner, our lack of economic opportunity, our society, have made us unable to provide.[@williams_living_1998, 305]

### Arts and culture

In 1969, the state established the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture (MCAAHC).

### Public housing

Public and low-income housing, both existing and new, served as an important site of organizing and of conflict during the late 1960s and 1970s. Tenants' rights groups organized among residents at Fairfield, Lafayette Courts, and Murphy Homes, among others. (see p. 176)

### Urban renewal projects

Faust:

> At the time of its inception, the Baltimore Urban Services Agency inherited 23 neighborhood centers from its predecessor antipoverty agencies. These centers were distributed across the city, with higher concentrations in East and West Baltimore, where the poorest neighborhoods were (and still are) concentrated. The centers occupied repurposed churches, storefronts, libraries, public baths, or (in the case of Dunbar) associated with an existing public high school. These diverse settings served as multipurpose centers for many programs and classes for children, teens, senior citizens, young mothers, the homeless, and families in crisis. Food pantries, yoga classes, poetry readings, dance performances, legal assistance, home heating assistance, library services, and many more programmatic offerings coexisted in these spaces.[@faust_neighborhood_2015, 55-56]

Low-income Housing on 1300 block of Madison Avenue:

> The Reverend Bascom, pastor of Douglass Memorial Community Church, purchased the entire 1300 block of Madison Avenue with church funds, renovated the buildings, and converted them to low-income housing. This development reflects the transition of the Civil Rights movement towards a renewed focus on community and economic development in the 1960s and 1970s.

Example from Upton:

- 1972: funds for the Upton project approved by federal government[@mcdougall_black_1993, 56]
- 1973 (McDougall says 1972): Nixon established a "moratorium on disbursements of federal money for such projects"[@mcdougall_black_1993, 56] (Source: This [history of HUD timeline](https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/about/hud_history) which also jumps from 1937 to 1965 without a single event in between!)

## School and housing segregation

- School segregation

### School segregation

1968 ruling in *Green v. New Kent County*: "free choice had to produce results: it had to integrate schools to be constitutionally acceptable."

After the city's "top legal officer" submitted a opinon calling Baltimore's school choice policy unconstitutional; Schaefer "had no interest in considering the Supreme Court decision and revisiting desegregation, because 'immediately the question of race comes in.'"[@baum_how_2011, 162]

January 1970 incident:

> A white teacher at Eastern High School reportedly used a racial slur with a black student. Students protests, and someone called the police, who allegedly mistreated students and eventually arrested eight. Students were sent home, and many went to Baltimore City College High School, where students joined the protest and City was also closed.[@baum_how_2011, 163]

Note: Baum continues to describe the proposal for busing in 1974.

White opposition to 1974 organized by the Southeast Desegregation Coalition (in part supported by the South East Community Organization?); then City Council member Barbara Mikulski wrote a letter to the editor of the *East Baltimore Guide*: "I am totally opposed to forced cross-town busing."[@baum_how_2011, 164]

In 1975, the Federal Office of Civil Rights begins enforcement hearings against Maryland.

### Housing segregation and discrimination

In 1969, a coalition of black and white civil rights advocates, including chairman Sampson Green, an African-American attorney, member of the Maryland Human Relations Commission, and housing committee chairman, and John J. Martinez, white Jesuit teacher at St. Bernadine's, organized The Activists—an interracial fair housing organization. The group targeted the Morris Goldseker Company with protests outside its downtown offices highlighting its role as "block-busters." Operating under a variety of names, the Goldseker-related realty companies doubled the mark-up on house sales in Edmondson Village in comparison to other areas. The Activists described how companies purchased houses for an average of $7,320 and sold them for an average of $12,387, a markup of 69%, with the inescapable conclusion that, "The dollar in the hands of the white man buys more than the dollar in the hands of the black man."[@orser_blockbusting_1994, 134-135]

Black Baltimoreans continued to contend with inequtities in access to both public and private investment.  In the spring of 1975, a new federal study found that lenders denied home loans to African American borrowers in Baltimore at twice the rate of white borrowers.[@schwerzler_reaction_1975] Maryland National Bank reportedly "rejected black applicants for home mortgages" at nearly twelve times the rate for white applicants in 1974.[@edsall_blacks_1975]

In his popular history of racial segregation in Baltimore, writer Antero Pietela highlighted the major role of Baltimore County politician [Dale Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Anderson_(politician)) in promoting segregated development during his term as County Executive from 1966 to 1974. Earlier efforts, beginning with the County's first zoning law in 1949, kept rowhouse and apartments confined to area of Dundalk and Essex-Middle River in eastern Baltimore County.[@pietila_not_2010, 226]

Later,<!-- What year? --> Spiro Agnew "ousted" the chairman of the Balimore County Community Relations Commission after he "endorsed open housing" saying he "confused civil equality with social acceptance". Agnew continued:

> Open occupancy legislation, the attempted crashing of private membership clubs, unlawful trespassing and unlawful demonstrating, violate the civil rights of others just as clearly as segrgeation violates the civil rights of the Negro. I take a strong position that it is wrong to tell the owner of a private dwelling place, be it single family or multiple unit, that he must offer it for rent or sale to anyone with whom he does not wish to do business. This applies whether or not he is biased and applies regardless of what his bias may embrace. If he dislikes Greeks he should not have to deal with Greeks, and the government that infringes upon his discretion in this rsspect abrogates his freedom of selection, and disregards the intent of the Constitution of the United States.[@pietila_not_2010, 228-229]

Dale Anderson, Baltimore County Executive, 1969:

> There are no walls around Baltimore County[@pietila_not_2010, 209]

Urban renewal plans for East Towson first approved by Baltimore County City Council in 1960; 1964 referendum defeated by voters (following “agitation, coordinated by the extreme right-wing John Birch Society”)[@pietila_not_2010, 229-230]

“Without access to federal funds, Anderson embarked on a rump renewal program for Towson…. a bypass road was constructed flanked by government and commercial offices. The end result was the same: East Towson’s black community shrank: Another pocket of African Americans, disappeared alogether, becoming the site of a high school, police and fire department headquarters, and, eventually, the county jail. In Catonsville, snack shacks and no fewer than ten gasoline stations replaced black homes at Baltimor National Pike and the Beltway”[@pietila_not_2010, 231]

County used zoning and “decimated at least twenty old African-American settlements throughout the county.”[@pietila_not_2010, 231]

Civil Rights Commission hearings held in 1970 at the Social Security Administration headquarters in Woodlawn[@pietila_not_2010, 234; @maryland_state_advisory_committee_to_the_u.s._commission_on_civil_rights_zoning_1971]

In 1972, the Social Security Administration annouced an expansion plan that anticipated 2,800 workers (mostly African American) moving to the Woodlawn area. Anderson opposed the plan, commenting:

> not one house in that bracket will pay enough taxes to educate one child, and how many of those people coming in here are going to have one child or more?[@pietila_not_2010, 234]

That same year, Anderson eliminated 4 key positions in the Baltimore County Planning Department (in the midst of what Pietila described as a “forward-looking plan to guide the county’s long-term growth”).[@pietila_not_2010, 235]

Department director Goerge Gavrelis “resigned in protest”; Anderson fired co-drector (?) Leslie Graef.[@pietila_not_2010, 236]

A few months later, Anderson “ordered real estate agents to report all sales to blacks to the police. He said he was acting at the request of the Real Estate Board.”[@pietila_not_2010, 236]

A representative Civil Rights Commission later responded that Anderson’s intention was to:

> clearly intimidate rather than help the potential black buyer in the county.[@pietila_not_2010, 236]
