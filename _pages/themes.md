We initially organized our documentation around six main themes based on the National Historic Landmark (NHL) program study _Civil Rights in America: A Framework for Identifying Significant Sites_ (2002, rev. 2009).

We added one more study on the theme of Confederate memory as part of our support for the Special Commission to Review Baltimore's Public Confederate Monuments in 2015.
