This is an incomplete directory of people identified as both supporters and opponents of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore. This directory is a working draft and *may contain errors*. We initially compiled this directory using [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) but migrated the data to [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) in June 2017.
