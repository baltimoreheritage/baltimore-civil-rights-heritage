## Introduction

In the years after emancipation and the Civil War, the Fourteenth (1868) and Fifteenth (1870) amendments to the constitution laid out a promise of equal protection and new political power for people who had been born free and the thousands made free in 1864. On June 22, 1885, Reverend Harvey Johnson invited five Baptist ministers to his home at 775 W. Lexington Street, seeking to make this promise real for Black Baltimoreans. The group formed the Mutual United Brotherhood of Liberty "to use all legal means within our power to procure and maintain our rights as citizens of this our common country." Born into slavery in Fauquier County, Virginia in 1843, Rev. Harvey Johnson arrived in Baltimore with his wife, writer Amelia Hall, in 1872 to serve as pastor at Union Baptist Church on Guilford Avenue. Under his leadership, the membership of Union Baptist Church had grown to over two thousand people—a powerful base of support for the Brotherhood's activist agenda.

By October 1885, the Brotherhood of Liberty won a fight to admit Everett J. Waring (1859–1914) to the state bar—making him Maryland's first Black lawyer. Johnson emphasized the importance of Black lawyers to the broader movement for equal rights, writing:

> there must be Negro lawyers, men who have themselves suffered and who will fight the people's fight, because the people's fight will be their own battles![@Collier-ThomasHarveyJohnsonBaltimore1991, 222]

Together with Waring, Johnson and his allies, waged an energetic campaign to against the state's prohibition on interracial marriage and discriminatory provision of the state bastardy law. These discriminatory laws, known to activists as the "black laws" had their roots in the antebellum era.[@HalpinReformingcharmcity2012, 11] A group of women connected to the AME church began raising money to pay to take a test case to the state Supreme Court. In early 1888, the Maryland State Legislature, facing legal threats and determined public pressure, delivered an indirect solution. The state updated the code of general public laws and dropped the word "white" from the state's bastardy laws and as the stated requirement for jury service or admission to the bar.[@BrackettNotesprogresscolored1890, 425-426]

The campaign's success was both symbolic—the recognition that the law's of the state should not discrimination—and practical as it cleared the way for Black Baltimoreans to use the law to continue to fulfill the promise of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments. On September 6, 1888, the Brotherhood of Liberty hosted a picnic at Irving Park near Annapolis Junction inviting Black Marylanders to gather together and celebrate their progress. "We ask not special legislation, but the enforcement of the law as it is," Rev. Johnson testified before a crowd of two thousand people, continuing:

> We must organize, raise money, contest our legal wrongs in the courts. We should agitate and contend until every vestige of color discrimination is swept from the laws. We demand educational facilities for our colored children; we demand colored teachers for colored schools; we demand the right to travel upon common carriers; we demand non-molestation by bad white men; we demand the same law meted out to other men. This is our case; it is just. The right will triumph.[@SunABOLITIONBLACKLAWS1888]

Historian Dennis Halpin observes how the Brotherhood of Liberty demonstrated "how black activists sought to further define the implications of the Fourteenth Amendment, draw the wider community into activism, and seek redress for various injustices." Their strategy of using legal test cases became the model for successful legal activism in the twentieth century.[@HalpinReformingcharmcity2012, 14]

But Black activists faced a growing challenge: an explicit and pervasive culture of white supremacy that increasingly dominated American society and politics in the 1880s and 1890s. White Baltimoreans, including Confederate veterans and memorial organizations, elected officials and the Democratic Party officials, deployed racist stereotypes and "Lost Cause" myths to justify lynchings, disenfranchisement, discriminatory employment practices, unequal schools, and unjust courts and policing in the late nineteenth century. "Scientific" racism spread through influential works such as [Frederick Hoffman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Ludwig_Hoffman) *Race Traits and Tendencies of the American Negro* published in 1896.

"Whites created the culture of segregation in large part to counter black success, to make a myth of racial difference, to stop the rising," observes Historian Grace Elizabeth Hale.[@HaleMakingWhitenessCulture2010, 21] In Maryland, the Maryland legislature rushed to pass a ban on interracial marriage in January 1884—just weeks after Frederick Douglass married Helen Pitts, a white suffragist and abolitionist.^[@SunINTERMARRIAGEQUESTIONColored1887; The 1884 law reaffirmed an existing ban on interracial marriage dating back to 1664.] The Democratic Party dominated city and state politics. After the Republican Party won the election of Mayor Alcaeus Hooper in 1895, the city's Democrats declared Baltimore a "White Man's City" and elected lawyer Thomas G. Hayes Mayor in 1899.

In Maryland and other southern states, white Democrats, and some white Republicans, made aggressive efforts to pass "Jim Crow" laws segregating public accommodations and disenfranchise Black voters. By January 1894, in a speech Metropolitan A.M.E. Church in Washington, D.C. Frederick Douglass despaired:

> I hope and trust all will come out right in the end but the immediate future looks dark and troubled. I cannot shut my eyes to the ugly facts before me.[@WilkersonWarmthOtherSuns2010, 40]

The U.S. Supreme Court decision in *[Plessy v. Ferguson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson)* (1896) encouraged the continuing proliferation of Jim Crow policy across the country. In 1904, Maryland passed a measure mandating require racial segregation on railroad coaches and, in 1908, extended the law to include electric trolley lines and steamboats.<!-- Black opponents in Baltimore secured "an exemption [from the law] for travel within Baltimore, but outside the city limits all blacks suffered the ignominy of being separated."[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 31] -->

The strengthening commitment to segregation came at a critical moment in the city's physical development and growth. Baltimore City incorporated the city's earliest suburbs with a major annexation in 1888. The extension of new electric streetcar lines out into the Annex the early 1890s supported the early growth of rowhouse districts segregated by threats of white violence and, later, restrictive covenants excluding non-white residents.<!-- TODO: Add more information about annexation and how it affected the city --> <!-- Add information about poverty and criminal injustice in this period. -->

Black residents organized to fight back where ever they could. <!-- Add information on publication of The Souls of Black Folks in 1903, critique of Booker T. Washington's approach; change public opinion to bring back the struggle for political and civic equality as essential for Black advacement, health of American democracy[@SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009, 2] --> Baltimore's Black churches, newspapers, political clubs, and civic organizations formed a chorus of people speaking out against the renewed attack on equal rights. Between 1856 and 1900, thirty-one black newspapers were established in Baltimore. In 1892, [John H. Murphy, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Murphy,_Sr.) (1841-1922), a veteran of the U.S. Colored Troops, established the *Afro-American* newspaper by merging his own church newsletter _The Sunday School Helper_ with two other publications, _The Ledger_, established in 1882 by [Rev. George Freeman Bragg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Freeman_Bragg), rector of St. James Episcopal Church, and _The Afro-American_, published by Reverend William M. Alexander, pastor at Sharon Baptist Church and a founding member of the Brotherhood of Liberty. Together with thousands of Black people in Maryland and Baltimore, Rev. Harvey Johnson's Brotherhood of Liberty frustrated "white attempts at disfranchisement and segregation" and laid the foundation for a new generation of activists.[@HalpinReformingcharmcity2012, 244-245]

<!-- Insert mention of the 1909 National Negro Conference -->

The city's growing network of Black activists, religious leaders, and lawyers carried the fight into the early twentieth century by joining a series of interracial coalitions to resist voter disenfranchisement in the early twentieth century. In the 1910s, Black lawyers, including W. Ashbie Hawkins (1862–1941), Warner T. McGuinn (1859–1937), and George W. F. McMechen (1871–1961), worked to defeat a series local housing segregation ordinances. The new Baltimore chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ([NAACP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP)) was established in 1912 but initially struggled with changing leadership and limited financial support. Pastor and educator Rev. James Robert Lincoln Diggs (1866-1922) at Trinity Baptist Church helped establish the Baltimore chapter of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League ([UNIA-ACL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Negro_Improvement_Association_and_African_Communities_League)) in 1918. <!-- TODO: Add sentence on meaning and history of UNIA (established in 1914). --> After the death of John Murphy, Sr. in 1922, Carl Murphy took over as editor of the _Afro-American Newspaper_ and sought to use the paper as an even more direct tool for documenting and protest injustice.[@FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998] <!-- Missing page number. --> <!-- Add information on early 1920s anti-lyncing campaigns. -->

The growing militancy of local activists faced an entrenched opposition that dominated local government and institutions. When Thurgood Marshall later recalled his growing up in Baltimore in the 1910s and 1920s, he noted: "The only thing different between the South and Baltimore was trolley cars. They weren't segregated. Everything else was segregated."^[See @ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 12; Thompson cites Juan Williams, "Marshall's Law," Washington Post Magazine, 7 January 1990, 12-17.] The city's small number of integrated spaces, such as parks and streetcars, were surely the scene of countless everyday acts of oppression and resistance. In the poem "Incident" published in 1925, Black, gay poet [Countee Cullen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countee_Cullen) recounts his own experience visiting Baltimore in 1911:

Once riding in old Baltimore,
​    Heart-filled, head-filled with glee,
I saw a Baltimorean
​    Keep looking straight at me.
Now I was eight and very small,
​    And he was no whit bigger,
And so I smiled, but he poked out
​    His tongue, and called me, "Nigger."
I saw the whole of Baltimore
​    From May until December;
Of all the things that happened there
​    That's all that I remember.

Racist ideas—white supremacy—continued to spread through Confederate culture, scientific racism, and popular entertainment. In 1903, hundreds of people, including Mayor and Confederate veteran Thomas Hayes, gathered on Mount Royal Avenue to dedicate the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument. When two advance agents for the notoriously racist play *The Clansman* arrived in Baltimore in March 1906, waiters at the Saint James Hotel located at the southwest corner of Charles and Centre Streets refused them service in protest reportedly with the encouragement of the "Constitutional League."[@MAYOSTRACIZEDR1906; The *Sun's* reference to the Constitutional League is likely a misidentification of the National Equal Rights League active nationally in this period.] *The Birth of a Nation*, D.W. Griffith's movie based on *The Clansman*, screened for the first time in Baltimore the evening of March 6, 1916 before a crowd at [Ford's Theatre](https://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/621) that "packed the house to its utmost limit." The 1871 theatre on Fayette Street near Eutaw Street, hosted the show for seven weeks reportedly "beating all records for length of run and for receipts."^[@BIRTHNATIONHERE1916; @FordBirthNation1916; Ford's Theatre was demolished in 1964 for the construction of a parking garage.] The *Baltimore Afro-American* newspaper closely followed a national campaigns, championed by the NAACP, to restrict the film's distribution. Two days after the opening night at Ford's, the newspaper reported that "yells of rage and screams of hate" elicited by the film "did not cease with the end of the show." The article quotes a "colored man" calling it "the most disgusting thing I have ever seen," and a white man coming out of a Saturday performance, saying, "I should like to kill all of the damn niggers in the United States."[@HateNation1916]

<!-- NOTE: National policy changes, e.g. Wilson resegregation of federal government facilities and federal government workers. Baltimore Branch joined branches in Boston, Detroit, Topeka, Denver, Takoma, Seattle, and Oakland, holding mass protests and engaging in letter writing campaigns to protests at over what the NAACP called Wilson's "officializing race prejudice"[@SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009, 29] -->

Widespread racism among Baltimore's white residents and the rigid segregation in most aspects of the city's public life shaped local Civil Rights activism. Interracial activism was seen as a radical and transgressive act when white members of the Communist Party began to support anti-lynching activism and organize interracial social in the 1920s. <!-- What year is this? For a symposium sponsored by *The Crisis* on Communism with seventeen newspaper editors; Carl Murphy, *Afro* noted the communists were the only white group to openly advocate "the economic, political, and social equality of Negroes."[@SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009, 154] -->

A more prevalent response by Black Baltimoreans, and some white supporters, was to "uplift" Baltimore's Black poor and working-class residents through education, civic activities, and religious work.

While unable to overturn the racist system of segregation, individuals could still work improve the material conditions of life for themselves, their families, and neighbors. For example, 1894, Dr. J. Marcus Cargill helped found Provident Hospital—the first hospital in Baltimore employing Black doctors and nurses.[@JacksonhistoryProvidentHospital1967; @BeanUpholdingBlacklife2010] Baltimore's early Black teachers, including Roberta Sheridan (c. 1864–1918) and Joseph H. Lockerman (1863–1923), worked under the burden of unequal pay and poor building conditions but remained dedicated to providing the best education they could to their Black students.[@NEGROEDUCATORDEAD1923]<!-- Missing citation for Roberta Sheridan. -->

<!-- Insert example on Rev. George Freeman Bragg (1863 - 1940) at St. James Church. Include information on class divisions. -->

Twenty-six-year old, Baltimore-native Harry S. Cummings (1866-1917) won election to the First Branch of the Baltimore City Council representing the city's eleventh ward in 1890. He had graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law just a year earlier and, when the *Sun* asked his plans after the election, he explained, "I will feel it my duty" to address the "special needs for colored people" especially "better school facilities."[@COLOREDCOUNCILMANPenPicture1890] In September 1894, Cummings spoke at a "colored people's fair" organized by the Baltimore County Industrial Association at the Timonium fair grounds. Then out of office, Cummings spoke on the importance of "morality, religion, frugality, and industry," arguing, "It is our duty to show the world the progress we have made."[@STICKFARMSExCouncilman1894]

<!-- Harry S. Cummings on work : https://search.proquest.com/docview/537211162?accountid=10750 and the "unfair and unjust restrictions imposed on" Black workers -->

Despite their success in overturning some aspects of the city's *de jure* segregation, activists were overwhelmed by the persistence of white neighbors who remained firmly committed to enforcing *de facto* residential segregation.

## Building political and social power for Black Baltimoreans

By 1890, Republican voters in the <!-- Which district? --> district succeeded in electing Harry S. Cummings as the first Black member of the Baltimore City Council.

In addition to new efforts to push for change through electoral politics, black activists also worked to advance civil rights within the church. Under Rev. Johnson’s leadership, for example, Union Baptist Church withdrew from the Maryland Baptist Union Association in 1892 in response to discriminatory pay for black pastors and unequal privileges for black churches within the government of the association.[@MarylandStateArchivesRevDrHarvey1998] In September 1897, Johnson delivered a speech in Boston, titled "A Plea For Our Work As Colored Baptists, Apart From the Whites," that criticized white churches for their failure to support black civil rights efforts:

> Why is the proposition never made to us of the necessity of co-operating in the work of abating the many forms of legal and socially oppressive laws and customs now in vogue all over the country, both North and South?[@Johnsonpleaourwork1897]

In 1898, Rev. Johnson organized the Colored Baptist Convention of Maryland. He also later played an active role in the founding of the Niagara Movement on July 1, 1905.

Another example of an important base of political and social power were fraternal organizations. For example, the Samaritan Temple at Calvert and Saratoga Streets hosted a "Colored Republican Mass-Meeting" in June 1884.[@ColoredPeopleOrganizing1884] Another example is Baltimore's chapter of the United Order of Moses at 527 Orchard Street. Established in 1868, the United Order of Moses had chapters in cities throughout the country. Black fraternal organizations in the period provided economic support for their members (typically in the form of insurance) but also played a critical role in supporting nascent Civil Rights activism. A joint meeting of African American mutual aid societies in Baltimore in 1884 turned out forty organizations with a combined membership of 2,100 people. By 1900, African Americans in Baltimore supported over seventy mutual aid societies – groups whose membership dues supported the purchase of halls and meeting spaces, burial costs for members, and social events throughout the year.[@MjagkijOrganizingBlackAmerica2013, 76]

Literary societies, composed of Black men and women at their homes, are another example of this trend. For example, the "Du Bois Circle" was founded in 1906 for "social uplift and higher literary attainment” with regular meetings for discussion on both literature and current issues affecting the city's black community. In the 1890s, a resurgence of the antebellum lyceum movement across the United States, led many members of Baltimore's Black middle class to form literary societies. Like the United Order of Moses and the Empty Stocking Circle, these groups often played an important role in providing mutual aid for African Americans and for organizing resistance to efforts to disenfranchise or segregate black Baltimoreans in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. As “Organizing Black America” (2003) noted:<!-- Fix this. Shouldn't be a pull quote and should be reframed to support a thesis rather than state the thesis. The whole paragraph should be re-read and revised. -->

> Generally operating with limited funds and an all-black membership, the civic and self-help groups accomplished much in spite of seemingly insurmountable opposition.[@MjagkijOrganizingBlackAmerica2013, 76]

<!-- NOTE: The next three paragraphs are pulled in from the 1905-1929 draft. -->

Organizing for the nascent NAACP remained difficult. In June 1920, [Addie Hunton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addie_Waites_Hunton) came to Baltimore as a field organized and helped to sign up two thousand new member that fall, but without active leadership the organization did not sustain the new support, returned to Baltimore in January 1923 for a mass meeting speaking alongside AME Bishop John Hurst, later asking, "Where did 2,000 members signed up in 1920 go? ... People are interested everywhere. We fall down on the field for want of a sustained leadership."[@SchneiderWeReturnFighting2002, 57]

While most labor organizing remained segregation, the IWW undertook an organizing drive among black longshoremen on the east coast beginning in 1917. Ben Fletcher organized dock workers in Baltimore and Philadelphia until he was arrested in Philadelphia and jailed until 1923 along with other Wobblies under repressive WWI-era laws.[@SchneiderWeReturnFighting2002, 376]

### Fighting for equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment

<!-- TODO: Look for information on literary societies and philanthropic groups in the nomination for 1232 Druid Hill Avenue. -->

Despite these challenges, African American activists succeeded in gaining a small measure of economic security, successfully defended the right to vote for black men, and continued to campaign for equality in education and housing.

Historian Bruce Thompson argued that these cases were distinct from earlier advocacy efforts by suggesting that the Brotherhood of Liberty in the 1880s and 1890s used the law to "defend black civil rights against encroachments by whites" but not "strengthen, re-establish, or expand black civil rights".[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 28] Thompson writes:

> These were important victories for the civil rights struggle because they showed that blacks could respond to segregation and the abridgement of rights and helped set the stage for the civil rights movement.[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 3]

In 1885, [Rev. Harvey Johnson](http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/stagser/s1259/121/6050/html/12414000.html) (1843-1923) founded the Order of Regulators, an early civil rights organization that Johnson renamed the Brotherhood of Liberty in 1887. One of the Brotherhood's efforts was to push for changes that would allow African Americans to become lawyers.

<!-- Note: Found this reference via Bruce Thompson (@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 25) who quotes a speech by Bettye Collier-Thomas. I'm quoting her published chapter on Rev. Johnson but I need to look at the original to make sure the quote is in there or I need to change the citation. -->

Such activist efforts led to key legal victories in 1885 when the Stewart Sisters successfully sued the Baltimore, Chesapeake, and Richmond Steamboat Co. for racial discrimination and when Charles L. Wilson succeeded in his suit to overturn the exclusion of African Americans by the Maryland Bar.[@HalpinReformingcharmcity2012, 94-96, 98-100] Under Johnson and others, the Brotherhood focused on defending the civil rights that Africans had already fought to secure during the Civil War. Thompson continues to explain:

> The law was used to defend black civil rights against encroachments by whites. Never did the Brotherhood initiate proceedings to strengthen, re-establish, or expand black civil rights.[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 28]

In the 1880s, the Brotherhood of Liberty also worked to amend the state Bastardy Act, challenge laws prohibiting intermarriage, push for improved education for black students, and represent the rights of black workers prosecuted during the [Navassa Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navassa_Island) trial.

The *Afro-American* wrote in December 1898:

> The Negro does not now nor has he ever contended for social rights with the white people. Social rights take care of themselves and no one can force them otherwise than where they belong. Meeting in lodge rooms does not carry with it meeting in parlors, or in dining rooms, or in the bosoms of families, riding in sleeping cars, eating and sleeping in hotels, or any other civil rights does not compel any man to invite any other man to his bed and board.[@CivilNotSocial1898]

<!-- Next section from 1905-1929 draft. -->

In Maryland, the state legislature passed a law in 1904 to require segregation on all railroads and, in 1908, extended the law to include electric trolley lines and steamboats.

Baltimore lawyer W. Ashbie Hawkins argued a test case against the racist transportation ordinance in 1920 without success and the law remained on the books up until 1951.[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 32]

### Fighting voter disenfranchisement campaigns: 1900s

Overall, however, Black political power in the late nineteenth century was undermined by the racism of the local Republican Party and gerrymandering by the Democratic Party to limit the influence of Black voters.

African American voters made up a small share of Baltimore's voters even after the addition of black women to the pool of eligible voters following the ratification the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. Historian Bruce Thompson describes how black voters lost influence as a share of the electorate in the early twentieth century. In 1900, African American residents made up 15% of the voting-age population and 15% of registered voters. In 1932, it was 16% of the population but only 12% of the registered voters. Thompson continues:

> Only in a few wards did the black vote make a difference in local elections. In 1931, four wards had a black majority and three others were evenly populated by blacks and whites.[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 33]

After Mississippi passed a new state constitution in 1890 that disenfranchised black voters (the so-called ["Mississippi Plan"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Plan)), white Democratic Party leaders in Delaware, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri all passed similar policies.[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 1]<!-- Double-check the list of states. Is this correct? -->

Outside of Baltimore City, the Democratic Party used a variety of strategies to illegally disenfranchise white and Black Republican voters. In November 1901, the *Sun* reported how "fully ten thousand ballots of legitimate voters" had been "thrown out on the most frivolous excuses." For Baltimore City, however, printed ballots meant very few ballots were "thrown out on the account of disfiguration or other inaccuracies."[@DemocratsStealState1901] Closer scrutiny by city's the larger population of Republican elected officials and voters may also have played a role.<!-- Check this -->

In Maryland, and in most northern states, activists found little political support for Civil Rights from either the Democratic Party, then dominated by white supremacists, or the Republican Party, which although more accommodating was still hostile and segregated black party members at local meetings and conferences by 1910.[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 32]

The state legislature also promoted the disenfranchisement of black voters in a series of proposals between 1905 and 1910. The three primary disenfranchisement were amendments to state legislation and known as the Poe Amendment (1905), Strauss Amendment (1908) and Digges Amendment (1910). By restricting the ability to vote based on ancestry and property ownership, these proposals threatened to eliminate the right to vote to thousands of Black Marylanders. The disenfranchisement campaigns drew support from both men and women. In 1905, W.M. Alexander wrote to the *Afro-American* calling for Black women to join the fight:

> We also appeal to colored women to do their part. The advocates of the Poe-amendment are urging the white women to help them and since the object of the amendment is to deprive colored men of civil and political liberties, colored women ought to do what they can to defeat it.[@AlexanderLetterEditorNo1905]

A mass meeting of around one hundred women at the Perkins Square Baptist Church (later demolished for the construction of George B. Murphy Homes) in October rallied opposition to the amendment.[@THEYMAULAMENDMENT1905]

White Republican party leaders like prominent Baltimore lawyer Charles J. Bonaparte also played a role in rallying opposition to these proposals, as historian Jane L. Phelps noted Bonaparte's opposition to the Poe and Strauss Amendments in 1905 and 1908.[@PhelpsCharlesBonaparteNegro1959] Women again supported the campaign in 1911, as the _Afro American_ reported:

> For the first time in the political history of Maryland, the Negro women of the city have been organized into a campaign committee for the purpose of working for the success of the Republican ticket.

Additionally, a new "Auxiliary Republican Committee" was chaired by Dr. Ernest Lyon and met at 414 W. Hoffman Street. The group was allied with the Anti-Digges Amendment League, an organization of "several hundred Negro women" led by president Eliza Cummings (mother of City Councilman Harry S.

A coalition of Black activists and recent European immigrants worked together under the banner of the Maryland Suffrage League to defeat all three proposals.<!-- Was the Maryland Suffrage League the vehicle for advocacy in all three campaigns? This whole section needs a little more clarity. --> Ultimately opponents to the disenfranchisement campaign succeeded, defeating the Poe Amendment with 104,286 to 70,227 votes in 1905, the Strauss Amendment 106,069 to 98,808 votes in 1908, and the Digges Amendment by 84,000 to 46,000 votes in 1910.[@SmithHereLiesJim2008, 65]

### Suffrage and activism by black women: 1890s–1920s

The ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920 marked new era in the history of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore and around the country. However, winning the right to vote was just one of the ways that black women grew in power and visibility as activists and organizers during this period. The opportunities black women won through their own activism and political victories helped shape the Civil Rights movement throughout the twentieth century.

The road for black women activists was a rocky one from the start. Following the 1890 merger of the National Woman Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association, an alliance that formed the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), the broader national suffrage movement began to systematically exclude black women in a bid to win more support from Southern white women and political leaders. The segregation of the suffrage movement encouraged the organization of independent groups for black women beginning with the Colored Women's League in Washington, D.C. in June 1892. In another example of black women organizing for suffrage, in 1896, the Colored Women's League merged with the National Federation of African American Women to form the National Association of Colored Women.<!-- Citation missing! -->

As at the national level, in Maryland the women's suffrage movement, led by groups such as Bassie Ellicott's Equal Suffrage League of Baltimore and Emma Maddox Funck's Maryland Suffrage Association, faced stiff opposition in the state legislature. A number of white-led suffragist organizations, Carrie Chapman Catt's League of Women Voters and the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (late known as the National Woman's Party) led by Alice Paul, sought to build support for women's suffrage among southern white political leaders and argued that suffrage for women would not challenge the white supremacist agenda of disenfranchising black voters.[@WaltonJr.EnfranchisementAfricanAmerican2012, 424-425] In March 1909, activist Edith Houghton Hooker hosted a meeting where Rev. Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National American Suffrage Association, spoke. The _Baltimore Sun_ reported on the event, writing:

>That all the leaders in the movement for woman suffrage do not extend their desire for women to vote to include all "colored sisters" was made evident last night by the two most conspicuous figures at the meeting of the Equal Suffrage League of Baltimore, in Friends' Meeting House, on Park avenue.[@OPPOSESIGNORANTVOTE1909]

That same year, Hooker broke with the established Maryland suffrage organizations to focus on the goal of passing a new Constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote. She founded the Just Government League and affiliated her organization with NAWSA.

Black women, however, could not be excluded from politics or Civil Rights activism. In 1906, reflecting on the organization of the "Federation of colored women of Baltimore and in the State of Maryland," J.T. Jenifer wrote to the *Afro-American Ledger* to argue that the organization, "will be a combined moral handmaid in the influence and aid of the Suffrage League, Niagara Movement, and Civic Councils, in every effort against jimcrowism, disenfranchisement and in every effort in race redemption, civil rights and uplift."[@JeniferForum1906]

During the 1912 campaign for a statewide bill to grant women's suffrage in Maryland, an editorial *Afro-American* observed how white women planned to deny suffrage to Black women calling it a "play to the galleries seeking to catch the favor of a few Negro haters in the legislature at Annapolis."[@BarNegroWomen1912]

When the House of Representatives voted on the Bristow-Mondell amendment in 1915, four members of the Maryland delegation voted against the proposal citing the enfrancisement of Black women as their main reason.[@MARYLANDSTOODOnly1915] In 1919, when the Senate considered the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Maryland's Senators split over the issue of women's suffrage with Democratic Senator John Walter Smith voting against the proposed amendment and Republican Senator Joseph I. France voting for it. When the measure came before the Maryland legislature for ratification on February 24, 1920, it was rejected again due to opposition to letting Black women vote. Despite Maryland's rejection of the measure, the Nineteenth Amendment won support in thirty-six states, and, with the approval of Tennessee on August 18, it became part of the U.S. Constitution on August 26, 1920.<!-- Citation missing. -->

Colored Women's Suffrage Club headed up by Mrs. Howard E. Young weekly meetings at Y.W.C.A. urging Black women to register at the polls on the first registration day, September 21, 1920. Mrs. Young remarked:

> We women are especially bitter against the type of white politicians who said that we would not know a ballot if we saw one coming up the street. We must register in order to vote, and we must vote in order to rebuke these politicians.[@PlanMeetingAid1920]

On November 2, 1920, women voted for first time in Maryland and, in 1921, the Women's Suffrage League of Maryland affiliated with the recently formed League of Women Voters of the United States.^[On November 7, 1922, Maryland voters ratified a separate state Constitutional amendment (Chapter 275, Acts of 1922) to allow women to hold public office.]

## Homes and neighborhoods: 1880s–1900s

### Development of a segregated Black community

The dramatic political and social changes for Black Baltimoreans during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century coincided and, in large part, produced the development of racially segregated Black neighborhoods. In the fast-growing areas at the edges of the city, builders sold houses with the implicit of explicit promise of excluding Black residents. Black Baltimoreans around the city center faced displacement through industrial and commercial development such as the expansion of the B&O railroad yards, the development of War Memorial Plaza, or later on the construction of Preston Gardens. But Black residents also moved to improve the condition of their housing and public spaces by leaving central Baltimore for the northwest suburbs. This section describes how the emergence of Baltimore's segregated Black neighborhoods as distinct areas in the late nineteenth century is evident in residential development and the buildings that supported neighborhood life, notably schools and religious buildings.^[The important role of segregated public schools in reinforcing emerging patterns of residential segregation is addressed in more detail in a subsequent section on education.]

Even as late as 1880, the city’s black population could be found distributed evenly over three-quarters of Baltimore’s twenty wards and eight districts. By 1890, however, a large share of Black Baltimoreans lived in the Eleventh Ward (what the neighborhood of Biddle Alley<!-- NOTE: Who called it this? Anyone other than the Sun? -->) where over 11,000 of the 21,269 residents were identified as "colored" (making the ward 51.74% non-white). By 1904, the city’s Northwestern District (including the Eleventh Ward) held more than 40% of Baltimore’s 81,381 African Americans.[@RobertsJr.InfectiousFearPolitics2009, 73] <!-- NOTE: I think I looked for additional population data beyond the sources cited by Roberts but I can't recall what/if anything I found. -->

The area included a mix of Black residents of varying incomes and backgrounds including both impoverished migrants and the city's nascent Black middle class residents. Historian Willard B. Gatewood described the character of Baltimore's "aristocracy of color" who were "relatively well-to-do" in the late nineteenth century:

> A black editor calculated in 1890 that about twenty individuals in the city's black community collectively represented a wealth of approximately $500,000. The wealthiest, John Locks, was said to be worth $75,000. Many of those included in Baltimore's black economic elite derived their wealth from catering, barbering, hod-carrying, brick-making, and caulking. ... Many of these individuals invested in real estate, so that by the turn of the century their heirs were often among the wealthiest blacks in the city.[@GatewoodJr.AristocratsColorBlack2000, 77]

<!-- TODO: I found a Joseph C. Locks in the [1890 R.L. Polk & Co directory](https://archive.org/stream/rlpolkcosbaltimo1890rlpo#page/760/mode/2up/search/locks) who worked as an undertaker and lived at 1515 Jefferson in East Baltimore. Unclear if it is the same person. -->

Poor housing and sanitary conditions in the areas of west and southwest Baltimore closest to the harbor and the city center pushed many middle-class Black households to seek housing in the west and northwest Baltimore. These areas had originally developed between the 1850s and 1880s along the city's suburban horse-drawn omnibus routes. Anne McMechen, George McMechen’s wife, later explained her family's aspirations for their 1910 move to McCulloh Street,<!-- NOTE: Double-check this. --> "we wanted to be more comfortable—a right I think everyone has to exercise."[@HalpinReformingcharmcity2012, 219] Black Baltimoreans who could afford to move left the formerly "aristocratic St. Paul street section," south Baltimore, and east Baltimore to for the northwest area.[@NorthwestNowCenter1926; The examples in this account include Black physicians Dr. Harry Brown, Dr. Edward J. Wheatley, Dr. Fowler, and Dr. Nelson Moquette suggesting the professional status of the early residents making the move into northwest Baltimore.]

A number of other factors reduced the demand for the areas now being sought by Black middle class households including the expansion of electric streetcar service in the 1890s and 1910s, the creation of a much-needed new sanitary sewer system in 1915, and the annexation of a large area of Baltimore County in 1918. Industrial and commercial development, the Great Baltimore Fire, the city's effort to widen downtown streets drove the gradual displacement of Black residents from the older areas around the harbor. Reverend Levi Coppin, pastor of Bethel Church from 1881 to 1883, called out the conditions of the area around Saratoga Street in 1881, suggesting "Bethel could not remain indefinitely in Saratoga St., among the iron foundries and hold a leading place among the Churches." The congregation ignored Coppin's entreaties to move until the city condemned the building in 1909 to make way for a wider Saratoga Street and the church finally moved to Druid Hill Avenue in northwest Baltimore in January 1911.[@MamiyaSocialHistoryBethel1994] <!-- NOTE: Missing page numbers! --> In 1905, the B&O Railroad began buying up property in the area bounded by Eutaw, Camden, Sharp, and Hill Streets. Demolition and displacement followed.[@SAIDBEBUYER1905] In June 1907, the B&O Railroad gave the Black residents of a three-story tenement at 912 Sharp Street just thirty minutes notice after a court injunction preventing the demolition ran out.[@HOUSESRAZEDNIGHT1907]

White landlords in the newly segregated Black neighborhoods in northwest Baltimore extracted as much rent as they could from the growing number of Black tenants. In January 1915, the *Afro-American* reported on the premium charged by white landlords in West Baltimore claiming Black tenants on Argyle and Myrtle Avenues, McCulloh, Lanvale, and Stricker Streets paid at least twenty percent more than the white households that had very recently lived there. Tenants who sought to purchase their homes ran afoul of exploitative rent-to-own schemes. The *Afro* concluded:

> A restricted residence area for the race tickles the whims of some of the whites, makes other whites rich and impoverishes the colored people who have, like the Jews in Russia, to live within the pale.[@SEGREGATIONBOONREAL1915]

In parallel with the move of Black residents into homes formerly occupied by white household, Black congregations moved into churches purchased from white congregations. After their displacement on Saratoga Street, Bethel A.M.E. Church bought Saint Peter’s P.E. Church, erected on Druid Hill Avenue in 1868. The speakers at the opening services included [William T. Vernon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Vernon), an A.M.E. church leader and Republican-appointed Register of the Treasury, who spoke on the "Birth of a New Freedom," declaring: "What the Negro desires in this country is the same law to govern him as govern the white man, in other words, a square deal." The next address came from James P. Matthews, an old member of the St. Peter's congregation that built the church in 1868, reflected on the "uptown" movement of white and Black churches and reassured the assembled congregation that the City Council's efforts to enact a segregation ordinance would ultimately not prevent members who sought "acquire homes within easy reach of the church."[@BethelChurchEnters1911]

Other congregations, built new sanctuaries using services from white builders and architects. Examples include [Saint Peter Claver Catholic Church](https://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/345) (erected on Pennsylvania Avenue in 1888) and [Union Baptist Church](https://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/585) (built on Druid Heights Avenue in 1905). [Sharp Street Church](https://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/520) purchased an existing church at Dolphin and Etting Streets<!-- Find name of prior congregation --> then tore it down to erect a new building in 1892.<!-- Consider adding architect names/races for all of these churches. -->

*Note:* St. James Episcopal moved west again in 1932 to occupy the former Church of the Ascension at W. Lafayette and N. Arlington Avenues. <!-- NOTE: Missing sources and a title for the table above. Add a footnote about St. James second move to Lafayette Avenue. -->

By the late 1920s, the area occupied by Black residents, churches, and schools in West Baltimore included parts of the neighborhoods now known as Madison Park, Upton, Druid Heights, Harlem Park, and Sandtown-Winchester. <!-- What about East Baltimore? --> In 1926, the *Afro* described the rapid changes residents had witnessed since the beginning of the century:

> The Baltimores' "Who's Who" has been constantly moving northwest in the city during the last 25 years… Although a few prominent families still live in the South and Northeast Baltimore, the bulk of the population now resides in that section of the city known as Northwest Baltimore. […]
> Oxford and Orchard streets once housed many of Baltimore's colored four hundred. Even Sara Ann street, now one of the most dilapidated and one of the worst streets in the entire city, once boasted the names of now prominent families.[@NorthwestNowCenter1926; The "colored 'Four hundred'" was a popular term for New York's high society in the 1890s.]

### Black communities in Baltimore and Anne Arundel Counties

A different process of community development took place for Black residents in more rural areas around the city. In Baltimore County, small Black communities grew up in the late nineteenth century as residents built churches and schools. St. Stephen's A.M.E. Church, established in 1870, replaced its original 1878 church with a new building in 1907 that stood until the existing building at 1601 Old Eastern Avenue in Essex was built in 1966. In the Big Falls community an African American schoolhouse on Hereford Road remained in use until 1936. The Cuba Road community near Cockeysville grew up around the Gough United Methodist Church first erected in 1875 and replaced in 1907. In Lutherville, the Colored School Number 24 opened in 1909 (making it the second oldest African American schoolhouse in Baltimore County).[@E.H.T.TraceriesAfricanAmericanHistoric2016]<!-- NOTE: Missing page numbers. --> In the early twentieth century, the industrial development of Baltimore extended out into the suburbs with the Bethlehem Steel's development of Dundalk and the growth of Turner's Station as a Black community. In the late 1920s, a few Rosenwald schools were erected in the general area including [Marley Neck Rosenwald School](https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/Anne%20Arundel/AA-2066.pdf) built in 1927 in Anne Arundel County.

Black residents in rural Baltimore and Anne Arundel County communities stayed connected to residents in Baltimore City through family networks and regional church organizations. The city and county also shared certain public institutions such as the Industrial Home for Colored Girls located in Melvale. The *Afro American* regularly reported on happenings in Baltimore and Anne Arundel County.

:n!The inadequate conditions of County school buildings and the injustice of unequal pay for Black teachers is a growing concern in the 1910s and 1920s. For example, in 1922 a white organization, the Women's Civic League of Catonsville, submitted a report the County school board on their area's colored school, calling it a "veritable fire trip… overcrowded and unsanitary."[@CivicLeagueCondemns1922] By 1926, the county government operated six high schools for white students but provided no public high school for Black students. Black households in the county could send their children to Douglass High School in Baltimore City but were required to pay transportation costs and tuition totaling over $150 a year. Fifty students made the trip in 1926 but, in 1927, the county instituted an examination for Black students that cut the number of eligible students down to just twelve.[@ONLY12BALTO1927] Black parents pushed back immediately with over three hundred participating in a rally held in Towson by the County-Wide Parent-Teacher Association of Baltimore County. Unfortunately, county school officials ignored the escalating protests for years.[@ENTERWHITEHIGH1927; @AyersOpenLetter1929]

### Urban reform efforts and the Great Migration: 1900s–1920s

This period also included significant discussion around how to improve housing conditions in increasingly overcrowded, segregated black neighborhoods.

In 1906, an influential report on housing conditions by Janet Kemp sparked a series of early reform efforts.[@HalpinReformingcharmcity2012; @RobertsInfectiousfearTuberculosis2002; @LiebWeCleanUpPaintUp2014]<!-- NOTE: Missing page numbers. --> However, the design of the local housing reform agenda was clearly shaped by white interests as with the large-scale clearance of the blocks of housing along Saint Paul Street (largely occupied by African American residents) to make way for the development of Preston Gardens in the 1910s.^[This topic is addressed in greater detail in our [incomplete thematic study on housing](/civil-rights-heritage/housing/) and our [study on Preston Gardens](/civil-rights-heritage/places/preston-gardens/).]

<!-- TODO: I'm not sure how to distinguish between moralistic and religious anti-vice campaigns and more genuine efforts to substantively address poverty. -->

Efforts to address poverty in Baltimore's Black community began to draw attention in the late nineteenth century. Baltimore's Colored Young Men's Christian Association organized in 1893 (following an 1891 meeting on the topic hosted by the Brotherhood of Liberty with William A. Hunton, the first YMCA executive of color in the United States).[@WilsonDruidHillBranch1989, 138] The organization grew and, in 1919, erected the Druid Hill Avenue Branch of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA).

In 1898, Rev. Ernest Lyon, pastor of the John Wesley Methodist Episcopal Church, delivered a paper, "Mortality Among Colored People," before the city's Ministerial Union inspired some early efforts to "agitate for the improvement of the condition of the colored people." Lyon linked the problem of mortality among Black residents in Baltimore to "the unsanitary condition of the section in which they live... inhabited almost exclusively by colored persons." Lyon argued the city and health department "take little pains to give the streets and houses proper attention" and noted how the "exclusion of the colored men from labor organizations" forced Black workers to accept low wages so they could not afford to buy "the proper kind of food."[@HOMESCOLOREDPERSONS1898]

Black women led the way in organizing around social welfare and community needs. In 1896, a group of Black women in Baltimore founded the Colored Young Women's Christian Association (CYWCA) joining a national movement gathered under the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs to promote "racial uplift."[@BowlingHowDidMultiRacial2002] After the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904, the Colored Empty Stocking and Fresh Air Circle organized to support Black dependent children.[@Neverdon-MortonBlackHousingPatterns1985, 219] The “Empty Stocking Circle” served as an African American counterpart to a charity led by local white women to make Christmas special for Baltimore's poor children. The “Colored Empty Stocking Circle” hosted events at churches, including St. John's AME Church and Union Baptist Church, often drew more than a thousand people. On August 1, 1908, [_The Freeman_](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2306&dat=19080801&id=rasnAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nAQGAAAAIBAJ&pg=5112,2008377&hl=en) reported on the group’s successful fundraising events at Druid Hill Avenue, writing:

> The Colored Empty Stocking and Fresh Air Circle, at Baltimore, which held a street carnival on Druid Hill avenue, Lanvale, Etting and Dolphin streets, last week, have used the proceeds of the sales to purchase a farm on the Emory Groves car line, near Reisterstown. The farm consists of a large dwelling, where the little ones will be entertained during the summer, and ten and one-half acres of ground. A number of improvements have been made, and it is stated that the price paid for the farm is $1,750. Miss Ida R. Cummings is president of the circle.

In 1910, the N.M. Carroll Chapter of Sharp Street Church's Epworth League opened a coffee shop and soup house in the "Windsor Flats" area of Baltimore.[@JamisonLeadingrolewomen2010, 83]<!-- TODO: Where is Windsor Flats? Where was this coffee shop/soup house? -->

Another example is the Women's Cooperative Civic League formed in 1913 "at the request of a group of white citizens to address housing, health, sanitation, and educational problems resulting from the rapid urban growth." Led by Sara Fernandis, the organization divided responsibility for different wards of the city among a group of community activists and grew their membership to 130 by 1914.[@GordonAfricanAmericanWomen1997, 124]

Felicia L. Jamison attributes the rise of female leadership within Sharp Street United Methodist Church to the fundraising work that women put towards paying down a $70,000 debt for the new church building erected in 1898.[@JamisonLeadingrolewomen2010, 44] In 1914, under the leadership of Rev. M. J. Naylor, Sharp Street Church established a community program that "included a kindergarten, a day nursery, and an employment bureau."[@JamisonLeadingrolewomen2010, 41] Efforts by female activists at Sharp Street Church culminated in the construction of the church's Community House: "a church-affiliated community center that housed young and poverty stricken women, and offered professional classes to the Baltimore black community."[@JamisonLeadingrolewomen2010, 5] The Community House Annual Report for 1921-1922 describes how the center sought:

> [to] provide a higher civic and social life, to institute and maintain educational and philanthropic enterprises and to investigate and improve conditions generally through co-operation with other social agencies.[@JamisonLeadingrolewomen2010, 6]

While church groups played an important role, historian Cynthia Neverdon-Morton has argued the interdenominational nature of this work was key as church women throughout the city "regardless of class or level of education, worked together in a number of social and charitable organizations to better their community."[@JamisonLeadingrolewomen2010, 80]<!-- FIXME: Double-check the page number for the reference to Neverdon-Morton. The quote is Jamison referencing Neverdon-Morton – I need to go back and review the original. --> The local efforts were also closely connected to the broader national movement. For example, in August 1916, Bethel A.M.E. Church hosted the tenth biennial meeting of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs.[@MEETINGCLUBWOMENNational1916]

Efforts to improve housing and sanitary conditions for Black Baltimoreans attracted support from white liberals making it one of the few areas of interracial organizing and advocacy in Baltimore and around the country. In New York City, the Great Migration and the growing Black population prompted reformers to meet on September 29, 1910 and establish the Committee on Urban Conditions Among Negroes (later known as the National Urban League). Unlike New York, Chicago, Cleveland, and other cities in the north and midwest where the Great Migration brought large numbers of black migrants from the deep South, Baltimore was largely a destination for black migrants from Maryland and Virginia. In 1910, 87% of the city's black population was native to Maryland and migrants from Virginia made up the largest share (8.7%) of those born outside of the state. In 1920, the share of native Marylanders declined to 76% but was still a sharp contrast with Detroit's 8.4% or Manhattan's 20.9% of native-born Black residents. By 1930, 59.4% of Baltimore's Black population was native to Maryland.[@CumberbatchBaltimoreMaryland2014, 18]<!-- Last sentence needs work -->

One of the most significant interracial organizations in this area was the Baltimore Urban League. Historian Ralph L. Pearson quotes a 1950 Urban League publication that traces the group's founding to the 1919 Hague Conference on World Friendship "which was the first volunteer gathering of representatives from the warring nations after World War I."[@PearsonNationalUrbanLeague1977, 523]<!-- This is awkward. --> As the group began to organize, it enlisted the assistance of the National Urban League's Department of Research and Investigations to conduct a three-month study of Baltimore industries and black workers beginning in March 1922.[@PearsonNationalUrbanLeague1977, 524] The study found that 62 of the 175 industrial plants that were investigated, employing 20,735 people, refused to hire Black workers. The study led to a meeting at the Emmanuel Church Parish House on May 7, 1924 to formally establish a local Urban League chapter.[@PearsonNationalUrbanLeague1977, 529]

The new group, directed by R. Maurice Moss, a white social worker, undertook a wide range of efforts. Over the next few years, the new organization helped to promote the development of Provident Hospital; conducted a survey of housing conditions in the area bounded by Druid Hill and Pennsylvania avenues, Biddle and Preston streets (the so-called "Lung Block" for its high tuberculosis rate); and organized a Black division of the Playground Athletic League.[@PearsonNationalUrbanLeague1977, 532]<!-- Cite some of the other sources on the "Lung Block"-->

<!-- Find a place to put this! That same year, the Colored Women's YWCA became formally affiliated with the Baltimore YWCA although the two organizations did not fully merge into a single integrated organization until the 1970s.[@BowlingHowDidMultiRacial2002] From 1920 onward, black women voters were critical to the success of Civil Rights activism in Baltimore. -->

### Creating and maintaining segregated white neighborhoods



- Violent attacks on Black households
- Discrimination in public spaces
- Legal requirements for housing segregation
- Deed covenants or property-owner agreements
- Exclusion through physical design

Threats of violence was an informal but consistent means for white residents to enforce the boundaries of their segregated neighborhoods in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. For example, in August 1899, crowds of boys and young men threw stones and bricks at 1805 Druid Hill Avenue breaking all the windows on the back of home. John Lang and his family were reportedly the only "colored" family on the block (the next nearest living south of Lanvale Street) and the attack forced Lang's wife and children to "shut themselves in a room" for safety.[@COLOREDFAMILYSCARED1899] In May 1902, after a Black household rented 1705 Druid Hill Avenue, assailants threw potatoes smashing three front windows and poured cans of sticky tar onto the home's white marble steps and window sills.[@COLOREDFAMILYUNWELCOME1902] In 1910, similar attacks took place on homes at 1802 and 1804 McCulloh Street.[@NEGROHOMESSTONED1910]

In 1904, park Superintendent W.W. Crosby established a new rule for Druid Hill Park "designating certain groves for colored and certain ones for white people." When the change in policy came to the attention of Black school groups denied use of park areas they'd used in the past, a delegation including Rev. Dr. Harvey Johnson, Dr. George F. Bragg, Dr. E.F. Eggleston, Rev. Dr. W.M. Alexander, and John H. Murphy went to a meeting of the Board of Park Commissioner on August 1, 1905 brought their case to reverse the change.[@JimCrowDruid1905] <!-- The petition was delayed becayse they didn't have quorum. -->

For years, white advocates of racial segregation had sought to make it illegal to rent or sell to Black households in so-called white areas and to enlist the police in enforcing these boundaries. On December 19, 1910, Baltimore City passed a new law require the racial segregation of residential blocks in Baltimore. Known commonly as the West Ordinance after the bill's proponent Councilman Samuel T. West, the bill was inspired by the purchase of a rowhouse on the 1800 block of McCoulloh Street several months earlier. As the first residential segregation law in the country, the ordinance has been the subject of detailed scholarly study over the past thirty years.[@PowerApartheidBaltimoreStyle1983; @NightingaleTransnationalContextsEarly2006; @RobertsJr.InfectiousFearPolitics2009; @BogerMeaningNeighborhoodModern2009; @HalpinReformingcharmcity2012; @HalpinStruggleLandLiberty2015] Historian Bruce Thompson described how the 1910 housing segregation ordinance worked, writing:

> This ordinance prohibited blacks from purchasing or occupying houses on blocks in which fifty-one percent of the dwellers were white. Similarly, whites could not move into blocks that were predominantly black.

Within a month of the bill coming into effect, twenty-six cases were brought before local courts.<!-- Courts or court? Were these suits caused by the city citing a property owner? Or people deliberately challenging the law? -->. According to Thompson, in the very first case, the judge "ruled that the law was invalid because it was drawn incorrectly."[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 34-35; @PowerApartheidBaltimoreStyle1983, 298-303] <!-- Why is this citing Power when it is a block quote of Thompson? Go back and look for Power's original source! -->

<!-- TODO: Add information about the block of McCulloh Street that served as a flashpoint for this conflict over segregation. -->

After the court overturned the first ordinance, the City Council passed a similar ordinance on April 7, 1911. The Council then quickly repealed and replaced the bill with a third segregation ordinance on May 15, 1911, entitled:

> an ordinance for preserving peace, preventing conflict and ill feeling between the white and colored races in Baltimore city, and promoting the general welfare of the city by providing, so far as practicable, for the use of separate blocks by white and colored people for residences, churches and schools.[@BaltimoreMdOrdinance1911]

In 1917, the U.S. Supreme Court decision _Buchanan v. Warley_ (1917) declared racial segregation ordinances (including Baltimore's) unconstitutional. While the decision limited the enforcement of Baltimore's segregation ordinance to less than seven years, the measure had a lasting effect, as Dennis Halpin notes:

> By the end of the 1910s, black Baltimoreans' resistance to the ordinances remade the city’s racial geography. Nevertheless, they struggled to challenge the strategies segregationists used in the wake of the laws’ demise.[@HalpinReformingcharmcity2012, 204]

Dennis Doster suggests that the NAACP's national advocacy around residential segregation has roots in this fight over segregation in Baltimore.[@DosterStrikeRightStrike2015] As Halpin and others argue, however, deed restrictions, racist practices by professional realtors, and racialized urban design and planning (described by some as "clearance and containment") all contributed to the persistence of segregation even after the 1917 decision.

#### Deed restrictions and exclusion through physical design

Local builders and developers almost never erected new homes for black buyers in the first half of the twentieth century. Some developers promoted their use of deed restrictions when building and selling new homes. In other cases, white residents organized to encourage neighbors to sign covenants and pressure property owners to refuse to sell or rent to Black households.

A few of the most notable examples of exclusion in Baltimore's segregated white suburbs is Roland Park, developed beginning in 1891, Guilford (developed beginning in 1913) and Homeland (developed beginning in 1924) served as models of racial exclusion for developers around the country. Paige Glotzer explains how the Roland Park Company:

> ...used deed restrictions as the cornerstone of a broader attempt to manufacture a dichotomy between suburban and urban space in order to sell a new spatial and social arrangement to a status-conscious white middle class. Other developers frequently requested copies of its deed restrictions.[@GlotzerExclusionArcadiaHow2015, 481]

Glotzer continues to note that at the national level, the National Association of Real Estate Boards (NAREB) adopted a Code of Ethics in 1913, the same year the Roland Park Company began using racial restrictions in deeds, and then revised the code in 1924 to prevent any realtor from:

> introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy, members of any race or nationality, or any individual whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood.[@GlotzerExclusionArcadiaHow2015, 488]

The Roland Park Company also planned physical boundaries between their developments and nearby properties occupied by black Baltimoreans. For example, the company planted "a long hedge to cut off sightlines of a predominantly black settlement down the hill, the same settlement where it later located its sewage disposal field."[@GlotzerExclusionArcadiaHow2015, 482-483]

Not all older neighborhoods could create the physical barriers employed by the Roland Park Company but they could use racial covenants. In January 1924, two hundred members of six West Baltimore protective associations met at the Fulton Avenue Presbyterian Church (at Fulton and Monroe Streets) to fight the movement of African American households into these western neighborhoods. The *Baltimore Sun* quoted Dr. C.P. Woodward, City Councilman for the 5th district, saying:

> The principal function of any organization is to acquire everything of benefit to the community and to keep away everything undesirable. It is a pity that law-abiding citizens who do not receive sufficient protection from the law to keep out undesirables must form protective associations to do so.[@PLANCHECKNEGRO1924]

The meeting sparked a campaign to seek signed commitments from 1600 property owners in an area bounded by North Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue and Bentalou Street willing to promise not to sell to African Americans. The _Baltimore Afro-American_, also reported on the meeting and summarized the sentiment of the speakers as, "Negroes should be put in a bag and pitched overboard."[@SegregationistsHoldStormy1924]

The racist panic by their white neighbors prompted Black Baltimoreans to dedicate new resources to organizing efforts. A new Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance was formed with a meeting on January 14, 1924 at Union Baptist Church.^[An earlier Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance organized in 1906 with a meeting at Sharp Street Church and plans for monthly meetings at Grace Presbyterian Church but had evidently dissolved in the interim.] The group established a "civic committee" led by Rev. D.G. Mack to aid in a "crusade against segregation."[@PASTORSORGANIZENEW1924] In a February 1924 editorial, the *Afro-American* commented on organized efforts to prevent "Negro invasion" as a "phase of segregation... more insidious and dangerous than an effort to legalize it for it is being nurtured and kept alive by the worst kind of racial hatred." <!-- Fix this sentence! --> Claimed the "dominant desire" of the Inter-Racial Commission is "to preserve good feelings between the races" and "missed a chance for definite good when it failed to state plainly whether it is for or against segregation."[@InterRacialCommissionSegregation1924]

When proponents of segregation took legal action to promote segregation policies, their efforts were less successful. For example, in 1918, a group of white residents in Lauraville attempted to have the 1917 sale of the Ivy Mill property to Morgan College revoked by the circuit court in Towson. The court dismissed the case and, after the Lauraville residents appealed, the state court upheld the lower court's decision.^[See @StockbridgeRussellDiggsvs1918; For more on the history of Morgan State University, see @WilsonHistoryMorganState1975; See also @DulaProsperingBecauseThat2016] Morgan Park, later home to W.E.B. Du Bois and Dr. Carl J. Murphy, and Howard Park in northeast Baltimore grew up despite the opposition of white neighbors.[@McConnellHistoryMorganPark2000]<!-- TODO: This passage on Morgan Park and Howard Park needs work! -->

## Schools and colleges: 1880s–1900s

### Advocacy for teachers and students in a segregated system: 1880s–1910s

Many of the buildings used for the city's segregated Black schools were originally erected for white students including Public School No. 103 (1877) at 1315-1327 Division Street which was converted for use by Black students in 1910. The former Western High School (later Book T. Washington Middle School) at 1301 McCulloh Street was converted in 1928 to house the Coppin Normal School, Colored Junior High School, and offices for the Baltimore colored school administration. A smaller number of schools were planned and built for Black students including Public School No. 111 at 1024 N. Carrollton Avenue (1889) and Public School No. 9 (1897) at 1431 N. Carey Street. <!-- Double-check this. Why doesn't 9 have a 100s style number? -->

In addition to advocating for schools where black children could attend, Baltimore leaders also began pushing the city to start hiring black teachers. As a result, in 1888, Baltimore school officials appointed Roberta B. Sheridan as the first African American teacher in the city's public schools.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 12] In 1888, Sheridan began teaching at the Annex Colored School No. 1 in Waverly before moving to teach at School No. 9 at Carrolton and Riggs Avenue in West Baltimore the next year. Historian Leroy Graham reflected on the significance of the move:

> With the acceptance of black teachers and a publicly funded high school, the blacks of Baltimore could breathe a sigh of relief after such a long and difficult struggle.[@GrahamBaltimoreNineteenthCentury1982, 222]

A decade later, the appointment of James H. Van Sickel, a school reformer Denver, as Superintendent of the Baltimore schools marked another major change as the city began hiring black principals and vice-principals.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 13] By the 1902–1903 school year, there were over 10,000 students and 166 teachers in the eighteen segregated black schools—nine of which were staffed entirely by black teachers. And, by 1907, all of the teachers for the Baltimore City Division of Colored Schools were African American.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 13-14]

Advocates for black students won a key fight for the city to hire black teachers with the appointment of Roberta B. Sheridan, a black educator, in 1888 and, by 1907, not a single white teacher worked in the Baltimore City Division of Colored Schools.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 14]<!-- This is in part because the compromise that allowed for Black teachers to be hired was a prohibition on Black and white teachers working at the same schools. -->

However, many of the city's segregated black schools operated out of older buildings with fewer resources than white schools. Of the eighteen schools open to African American students in 1900 many were built before the Civil War, including School No. 116 at Druid Hill Avenue near Biddle Street (1842); School No. 109 at Fremont and King Streets (1843); and School No. 101 at Jefferson Street near Caroline Street (1855).[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 15]<!-- Is this repitious with the early section on Black schools? -->

Historian Samuel Kelton Roberts noted the challenges for black students attending the city's segregated schools, writing:

> Baltimore’s black public schools were crowded and in disrepair, housed in the cast-off buildings left behind as whites moved to better facilities. ... Despite the reorganization of the city government and the educational system, no new black schools were built between 1898 and 1915.[@RobertsInfectiousfearTuberculosis2002, 28]

Frequently, white Baltimoreans opposed the location of Black schools near segregated white neighborhoods or the conversion of public schools for use by Black students. For example, one resident complained the presence of Morgan College at Fulton and Edmondson Avenues in a 1913 letter to the *Sun*.[@WhiteMorganCollegeWest1913] In 1915, white residents protested the conversion of the white School No. 39 at Carrollton and Riggs Avenues.[@PROTESTNEGROSCHOOL1915]

Another improvement in education came as the Maryland State Teachers Association (also known as the Maryland Progressive State Colored Teachers Association) campaigned in 1915 to extend the school year for black students who had a shorter school year than white students.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 18]<!-- FIXME: Double-check that the Maryland State Teachers Association and the Maryland Progressive State Colored Teachers Association are the same entity. -->

Some observers saw the absence of any African American members of the Baltimore City School Board as a barrier to addressing unequal pay and lack of training for teachers and the inadequate school buildings they worked in. In 1919, when the editors of the *Baltimore Afro-American Newspaper* demanded Charles Koch, the superintendent of schools, hire an African American superintendent, Koch responded that:

> Blacks were not far enough developed to have a school board member, but would do well as members of the street cleaning force.[@FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998, 36]

<!-- Add information about the divisions regarding education, e.g. around vocational training, and accommodationist attitudes. -->

Advocacy for improved teacher pay also included white allies. For example, in 1920, white representatives of the taxpayers Civic League, Mrs. Edward Shoemaker, and the Interracial Conference, Dr. Peter Ainslie, appeared before the Board of Estimates to urge making the salaries at the Colored High and Training Schools the same as those at white high schools.[@QuestionAgainCitizens1920]

### Strayer Survey and colored school reform efforts: 1920s

One important example of the changes that took place in this period was the efforts that led to the publication of the Strayer Survey evaluating the condition and management of Baltimore schools, both white and black. The Strayer Survey was a comprehensive look at the problems of Baltimore's public schools: overcrowding, inadequate facilities, poor curriculum, and out-dated management practices.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 23] When the report was published in 1922, it offered the possibility of "a real opportunity for the segregated schools to participate in much needed school reform".[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 36] Among the recommendations was the suggestion that the schools open all trade and apprenticeship programs to black students.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 34]

Although the white school leadership did not promise any immediate action, the report did result in the hiring of the first black director of the Baltimore City Division of Colored Schools, Dr. Francis Russell, in 1923.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 37] After Russell was denied the resources for the administration of his program, he resigned in August 1924. Angelina Johnson describes the appointment of Russell's successor:

> On August 1, 1925, Francis Marion Wood was appointed supervisor of all African American schools of Baltimore City; he would stay in the position until 1943, overseeing many changes. With a starting salary of $4200 per school year, Wood relocated to Baltimore with his wife Nellie and their four children. Wood's position included the responsibility for implementing and overseeing the recommendations of the Strayer Report. Supervisor Wood reported to David Weglein, who was Superintendent of Public Instructions and who reported to the nine members of the Board of School Commissioners, the Mayor, and the Baltimore City Council.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 40]

Finally, in June 1925, the Defense League (a group of black activist lawyers) won a temporary injunction from a Baltimore court requiring equal salaries for white and black teachers. While the decision was overturned by a higher court, it prompted a promise from Mayor Howard Jackson in October 1926 to begin offering equal salaries in the 1927 school year.[@FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998, 33] In 1929, superintendent Dr. David E. Weglein told the state Interracial Committee that the "city gives colored teachers equal pay and school children equal per capita appropriates." This was in stark contrast to the rest of the state where the average pay for Black teachers was just $586 about half of the $1,126 paid to white teachers.[@BaltimoreMaryland1929]

Beginning in 1926, Wood began to attend the annual conference organized by Carter G. Woodson's Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. Wood introduced a Negro History week in February to celebrate the history of African Americans. Johnson notes: "Each segregated school was responsible for creating and sponsoring their own Black History program.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 47]

### Fighting for a Baltimore County high school



## Courts, prisons, and injustice: 1880s–1920s

The administration of criminal justice was deeply unequal for white and Black Baltimoreans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The exclusion of Black men from juries, the segregated police force, discriminatory approaches to policing in increasingly segregated Black neighborhoods, and the criminalization of behavior for Black residents that was tolerated for white residents all contributed to this issue.

One clear example of this disparity is found in the population of the Baltimore City Jail and Maryland Penitentiary. Black people only made around sixteen percent of the city's population in 1880 but they made up over thirty percent of the people confined to the City Jail in 1883.

<!-- City Jail built east of the Jones Falls on Madison Street between 1855 and 1859 the over-representation of Black people Moreover, the city's police, prisons, and courts reflected to the city's broader racial inequality -->

The over-policing of Black Baltimoreans in some circumstances is matched by an under-policing of violence directed against Black people. Lynching and violence by white urban mobs are both examples of this. If Black Baltimoreans were attacked by white residents, they had difficulty finding justice in the courts.

Between 1882 and 1911, white people in Maryland lynched thirty-one African Americans. This was a small part of a national wave of political violence against African Americans. In the case of Wilmington, North Carolina, white residents supported an armed insurrection in 1898 to overturn the local elected government led by Black officials.

Lynchings began to happen less often in the early twentieth century but outbreaks of urban violence in cities in southern and northern states, such as the [Atlanta race riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_race_riot) in 1906 or 1908 riots in Springfield, Illinois, terrorized Baltimoreans. A riot in East St. Louis, Illinois in July 1917 prompted a mass meeting at Bethel A.M.E. Church that sent a delegation (including Dr. Carl J. Murphy) to meet with President Woodrow Wilson and urge him to investigate the riot and take action to address the issue.[@FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998, 125] <!-- Mob violence, such as the wave of riots that affected many American cities in 1919 known as the [Red Summer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Summer), was also a source of major concern for local activists. -->

 On December 18, 1918, the new local division of UNIA (then led by William D. Rankin) highlighted the terror of lynching with an event at Bethel A.M.E. Church (cosponsored by pastor Rev. William Sampson Brooks) featuring both Marcus Garvey and Barnet.[@MamiyaSocialHistoryBethel1994, 250-251]

<!-- NOTE: What year? -->NAACP branch president Rev. Monroe Davis introduced Dyer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyer_Anti-Lynching_Bill) at a mass meeting with 2,000 people at Bethel AME Church; part of a "sustained battle for public opinion"[@SchneiderWeReturnFighting2002, 179]

Anti-lynching legislation emerged a major issue for local activists in the early twentieth century and remained an important concern up through the 1940s.^[For additional information on the history of lynching in America in southern states, students and researchers should look at the [American Lynching website](http://www.americanlynchingdata.com/) and the Equal Justice Institute's report ["Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror"](http://eji.org/reports/lynching-in-america).]

Baltimore activists saw their proximity to Washington, DC as an obligation to support national efforts to lobby federal officials over lynching and related issues.[@FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998 includes a detailed account of the efforts of Baltimore activists lobbying for federal anti-lynching legislation.]

<!-- TODO: Update the above footnote with page numbers for the relevant section. -->

The physical violence of the period took place concurrently with the local and national resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan. In early 1923, the Klan presented a charity circus in Hazazer's Hall at 111 W. Franklin Street (the present site of the Enoch Pratt Library Central Branch) to publicize the organization's endorsement of Protestantism. After the circus, Klan members visited the United Brethren Church and the Roland Avenue Methodist Church at 40th Street and Roland Avenue. The pastor at Roland Avenue accepted a $25 donation from the visitors, remarking, "I, for one, am glad to get it." Although the Klan stayed active that year, not everybody embraced them. In March 1923, for example, a Klan meeting at the Brooklyn First Baptist Church at 3801 5th Street was "almost broken up by an angry mob."[@JacksonKuKluxKlan1967, 181]

While the majority of lynchings in Maryland took place on the Eastern Shore and in Southern Maryland, black residents in Baltimore did face an immediate threat of police violence and a broader challenge of criminal injustice. Noted incidents of police violence in this period include a police officer beating a black WWI soldier (an action criticized in February 1918 by Judge Robert F. Stanton who later served as Police Commissioner from 1938 to 1943); the police shooting of a black man on Pennsylvania Avenue on June 1, 1918; Baltimore police officer James O. Jones "beating up" Henry Boyer in 1926; and a police officer clubbing Henry Simuels in 1927.[@SoldiersPolice1918; @PennaAveShooting1918; @BRUTALITYPOLICEMANFLAYED1926; @RAISEPROTESTPOLICE1927]<!-- Our thematic study on [Criminal Injustice](/civil-rights-heritage/criminal-injustice/) addresses these incidents and others in more detail.--> Black residents responded to these incidents with letters of protest, mass meetings, and other forms of organized activism. As a student at the the Colored High School on Pennsylvania Avenue in the early 1920s, Thurgood Marshall had a close-up view of how Baltimore's police officers treated black suspects at the Northwestern District Police Station next door. In _Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary_, Juan Williams quotes Marshall’s recollection of what he heard, writing:

>We could hear police in there beating the hell out of people, saying, "Black boy, why don’t you just shut your goddamned mouth, you’re going to talk yourself into the electric chair."[@WilliamsThurgoodMarshallAmerican2011, 40]

Black residents in Baltimore experienced the dual challenges of being both over-policed and under-protected as white people who committed crimes against black people could expect much lighter penalties for their actions. Sexual violence against Black women was a particular area of concern. Famed anti-lynching activist and journalist [Ida B. Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_B._Wells) cited an example from Baltimore in _The Red Record_ (her early 1890s study of lynchings in the U.S.), describing how a black woman in Baltimore "was out walking with a young man of her own race" when she was attacked by a group of white men who "held her escort and outraged the girls... The case went to the courts and they were acquitted."[@Wells-BarnettRedRecordTabulated1895] In July 1907, the *Afro American* observed what they called a "epidemic of rape perpetrated by white men of this vicinity." Moreover, the paper concluded "the worst of it is that few of them meet with the punishment they deserve."[@WhiteMenRapists1907]

For example, on February 1, 1921, five hundred people gathered at Trinity Baptist Church at Druid Hill Avenue and Mosher Street to protest the release of a white man, Harry Feldenheimer, on a $500 bail after police arrested him for an attempted assault on a ten-year-old black girl named Esther Short. The *Afro* reported that participants in the meeting criticized the "brutality of the local police, exclusion of qualified men from the police force and from juries in the city, and the Jim Crow arrangements for colored people in the Criminal and Juvenile Courts".[@MASSMEETING5001921] A 1926 report from the _Afro_ called attention to racism in the use of capital punishment in Maryland. Observing that between 1903 and 1926, nine of the ten men executed in Maryland for murder or rape were black, the newspaper called for an end to the death penalty.[@FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998, 115-117]

Activists sought to address these problems through stronger oversight of the police and the appointment of black police officers. In 1925, the Conference of AME Ministers set up a committee to consider the best way to place black officers on the police force.[@FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998, 112] Although such efforts were largely unsuccessful in this period, the work by activists led to forcing the city and state to begin to address their concerns in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

Black residents in Baltimore and Anne Arundel Counties even greater discrimination before the judicial system than city residents. A 1918 report in the *Afro American* suggests that even the "oldest inhabitant" of the area "could hardly recall" any opportunity for a Black man to participate in a Grand Jury.^[@SleepingOurRights1918; The report added "As for petty juries, even Baltimore has been very lax for the past several years."] In 1921, the paper observed how Baltimore County District Court Judge Frank I. Duncan, as he granted Charles H. Brooks a new trial, had told a jury that "there is no doubt in his mind that the man is guilty of raping a white woman." The *Afro* saw a pattern of discrimination citing two recent examples of Black men convicted of crimes "even though there was genuine doubt among some as to their guilt."[@LynchingRecord1921]

## Employment discrimination

In October 1889, the City Council considered an ordinance regulating hiring by the city commissioner's office and narrowly voted down an amendment by Councilman D. Meredith Reese limiting employment to "white citizens" only. Reese opposed "mingling white and colored men in work," argued the "colored workman is not equal to the white workman," and, when his colleague's questioned the constitutionality of the amendment, Reese argued that the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply to Baltimore City.[@TRYINGCOLORLINE1889]

In 1898, an editorial in the Afro-American highlighted that, despite Black voters making up an estimated one-third of Republicans in Baltimore City, the Mayoral administration of employed six or seven hundred white people in city agencies but appointed only three Black superintendents of street departments to supervise groups of Black workers.[@QuestionPatronage1898]
