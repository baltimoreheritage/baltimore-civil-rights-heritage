## Introduction

The Great Depression began with the Black Tuesday stock market crash on on October 29, 1929. For African Americans in Baltimore, already burdened by employment discrimination and segregated housing, the national economic crisis brought widespread job loss and even deeper poverty. While decades of legal and political advocacy prevented the mass disenfranchisement found in other Southern towns and cities, racism by white neighbors and widespread segregation made life difficult for Black Baltimoreans.<!-- Add some figures from the Urban League report?--> "Baltimore is a border city with Southern feelings" observed the *Baltimore Afro-American* in 1933.[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 11] In response to these new challenges, African Americans in Baltimore, joined by some white supporters, organized and pursued a renewed campaign of protests, fighting for equal employment and education at home in Baltimore and around the country.

In October 1931, Juanita Jackson and her sister<!-- Name missing --> responded to the shortage of jobs for Black young people by organizing City-Wide Young Peoples Forum. Activist [Nannie Helen Burroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nannie_Helen_Burroughs) (1879–1961) later described the group as: "the best, most progressive, and analytical organization of Negro young people in America. It feels, thinks, believes, acts."[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 42] Building on the popularity of the group's regular meetings at Sharp Street Church<!-- Check location-->, in 1933, Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson, president of the Baltimore NAACP and Juanita's mother, Thurgood Marshall, and others recruited hundreds of young people to the "Buy Where You Can Work" campaign protesting businesses on Pennsylvania Avenue that refused to hire Black workers. The lynching of George Armwood on the Eastern Shore on October 18, 1933 galvanized Baltimore's Black residents and drew support for a national, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, campaign to pass a federal anti-lynching law.<!-- Citation needed. --> White and Black members<!-- Check this --> of the Communist Party helped lead protests against the inequitable relief payment for black families.<!-- Need a transitional sentence. Is this the BERC or the Works Progress Administration?-->

At the beginning of World War II, the rapid growth of the city's black population during the 1940s pushed the issues of housing and criminal injustice to the forefront. The Fair Employment Practices Commission<!-- Established what year? Led by Clarence Mitchell. --> gave Black workers a new tool to protest discriminatory hiring and management practices by local industrial employers. After a Baltimore City police officer shot and killed a black U.S. Army private from Pittsburgh, a coalition of local activists including Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson and Dr. John E.T. Camper, a physician and activist associated with the Citizen's Committee for Justice and the Progressive Citizens of America (PCA), organized the March on Annapolis. On April 24, 1942, hundreds<!--Thousands?--> of Baltimoreans rode buses, drove, and even walked to the State House for the largest Civil Rights demonstration in Maryland history and won the creation of a new state commission that promised to address their concerns over police brutality and racial discrimination.<!-- What did the state commission promise? --> <!-- Segregation meant many activists were also neighbors but housing was also stratified by class, e.g. The residences of notable leaders were similarly in nearly all-black neighborhoods including the Dr. John E.T. Camper House (built c. 1885) at 639 N. Carey Street and the Dr. Carl J. Murphy House in Morgan Park. -->

After the war ended in 1945, African American residents began buying homes in segregated white neighborhoods west of Fulton Avenue. The city's Black population grew over sixty percent between 1930 and 1950 turning the housing shortage for Black residents into an intolerable crisis. The move into new neighborhoods reflected not only necessity, however, but also the rising aspirations and expectations of many African Americans after World War II.

Thanks both to a growing population Black voters in Baltimore City and extensive voter registration efforts by the NAACP, the liberal Republican Theodore McKeldin had won election as Mayor in November 1942.<!--Check this.--> As Mayor from 1943 to 1947 and Governor from 1951 to 1959, Theodore McKeldin delivered incremental change as he ended segregation at all state parks in 1953 and at public pools and beaches in 1955. In 1951, the Maryland legislature finally changed state laws that had required racial segregation on trains and boats.

At Ford's Theatre on Fayette Street, student protests against racially segregated seating began in 1948. Five years of pickets organized by the NAACP, boycotts, and pressure from Governor McKeldin finally forced the desegregation of the prominent downtown Baltimore theatre in 1953.<!-- Mention "Hitlerism" or role of Cold War politics in changing segregation policy? Who pushed the Maryland legislature to change in 1951? --> Members of the local CORE chapter (an interracial organization established in Chicago in 1942) continued to push downtown businesses. Between 1953 and 1955, students from Morgan State University joined members of CORE on the 200 block of W. Lexington Street  for a series of nonviolent sit-in protests against discrimination against Black diners at "five-and-dime" lunch counters.<!-- Mention the role of local and national chains in extending small wins into big wins. --> In 1960, student activists led the push for desegregation at downtown department stores and restaurants on Howard Street including Hutzler's, Stewart's, and Hoschild-Kohn's.

The Baltimore Urban League avoided protest in favor of negoating directly with local businesses and segregated union locals to change discriminatory practices. For example, in 1951, the Urban League worked with the Yellow Cab Company and the AFL Taxicab Operators Union to begin hiring Black drivers and, in the spring of 1952, with the Baltimore Transit Company and AFL Transit Workers Union to begin hiring Black bus drivers and streetcar operators.[@CannonEFFORTHIRINGNEGROES1953]<!-- What about integration of Baltimore Polytechnic> -->

The gathering momentum and urgency of the Civil Rights movement following the Supreme Court decision in *Brown v. Board of Education* helped acitivists win federal changes the [Civil Rights Act of 1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957) and the [Civil Rights Act of 1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1960). The 1957 legislation, signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, was the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction, created the [U.S. Commission on Civil Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Commission_on_Civil_Rights). The Commission—though initially limited to fact-finding—played a key role in  documenting injustice. Congress granted the Commission expanded authority under the 1964 Civil Rights legislation. Women also won new protections with the [Equal Pay Act of 1963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Pay_Act_of_1963) and new protections against gender discrimination in the [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964).

Baltimore's proximity to Washington, D.C. helped tie the work of local activists into a broader national agenda. For example, in 1961, after embarrassing incidents of discrimination against African diplomats at restaurants along U.S. Route 40 in Maryland and Delaware<!--Where?-->, CORE activists saw an opportunity to push for broader change. CORE recruited volunteers from Baltimore's Civic Interest Group (CIG) and several other organizations for the "Route 40 Project" to challenge the segregated facilities in a massive Freedom Ride on November 11. Just days before the ride began, however, forty-seven restaurants along Route 40 agreed to desegregate thanks to the activists and pressure from the Kennedy administration. CORE called off the ride but sent the volunteers gathering at Howard University to Baltimore instead where they picketed to protest the city's segregated restraurants.<!-- Where? Little Italy and...? -->[@BanksCORERoute402011; @ErdmanEyesworldRacial2007] Two years later, in 1963, Black church leaders, business owners, and activists worked to recruit and transport thousands of Baltimore residents to Washington, D.C. in support of the [March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom).

While some white Baltimoreans sought to promote integrated neighborhoods through groups like Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. (founded in 1959 by James Rouse, Ellsworth Rosen, and Sidney Hollander, Jr.), many more relocated to the segregated white communities in the suburbs. As thousands of white residents left the city for federally subsidized suburban developments the population of Baltimore County more than tripled between 1940 and 1960. The expansion of highways, including the Jones Falls Expressway (I-83), the planning of the Franklin-Mulberry Expressway, and the Baltimore Beltway (I-695) which opened in stages between 1955 and 1962, made it easier for white commuters to move away.<!-- Citation missing. --> In 1958, the Maryland State Commission on Interracial Problems compared Baltimore to cities like Detroit or Chicago where violent attacks on new Black neighbors were common and observed that Baltimore's problem "is not with violence but with the frigid withdrawal" of white residents.[@OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994, 133-136] Black Baltimoreans were excluded from the suburban migration by mortgage discrimination by private banks and the Federal Housing Administration and exclusionary zoning policies.

<!-- Break up this block quote and find additional sources to reference.

Scholar Harold McDougall described how the federal and local policies supported the development of segregated suburbs in Baltimore and Anne Arundel Counties, writing:

> Exclusionary zoning, though couched in terms of income rather than race, had the practical effect of reinforcing existing divisions along racial lines simply because if you were blacks could afford the suburban housing made more expensive by such regulations.[@McdougallBlackBaltimoreNew1993, 49] -->

The election year marked twelve years after the *Brown* decision and twenty-four years after the consequential March on Annapolis. Despite decades of unprecedented activism that overturned most of Maryland's Jim and Jane Crow policies, African Americans in Baltimore continued to struggle against white resistance and racist policies, against employment discrimination, segregated and inadequate housing, unequal educational opportunities, and racist policing. The contradiction between the apparent success of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore and Maryland with the continued challenges facing Baltimore's black residents again drew the attention of national activists such as Martin Luther King and CORE with their designation of Baltimore as a "Target City" that summer.

Mayor Theodore McKeldin reflected on the city's still limited progress Baltimore in June 1966:<!-- Trim this block quote! Also – note the way it speaks to a white audience when it says "We". -->

> In response to those who might say that we have made significant progress in the field of civil rights, I could say that I agree; but, I would also have to say that there are problems – important problems – which have thus far not been resolved; and I believe that this City can no longer delay meeting its responsibilities, both in the public and private sectors of community life.
> The fact is that while we have moved, we have not moved toward the solution of these problems with the speed and vigor with which we are capable.
> We have not really attempted, as a community, to understand the plight, the unrest, and the feelings of those who have been denied.
> We have not attempted to understand why, even after significant progress, our negro brethren still insist that all is not right nor community – that there is much to be done.[@McKeldinStateMayorTheodore1966]

In the next section, the study highlights some of the places associated with the Civil Rights movement in this period. The study continues to describe four key themes in detail:<!-- Update these summaries for the expanded time period. -->

- Politics?
- **Housing**: A severe shortage of housing created difficult conditions for thousands of black Baltimoreans. This issue framed the struggle to build public housing for African Americans and pursue opportunities to purchase homes in formerly segregated white neighborhoods after World War II.
- **Education**: As the NAACP continued to campaign against segregated schools locally and nationally, black educators and administrators continued to build on the 1921 Strayer Report to improve conditions for Baltimore's black students.
- **Employment**: Black workers also sought better conditions and more job opportunities and found a partner in the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).
- **Public Accommodations**: White allies and African American students served as key supporters for activist efforts that opened public parks and recreational facilities, along with some (but not all) shops, restaurants, and theaters by the early 1950s.
- **Criminal Injustice**: Baltimore activists participated in national anti-lynching advocacy and fought police and mob violence in Baltimore. Activist efforts led to the city's first black uniformed police officers following the 1942 March on Annapolis.

<!-- TODO: Revise the comments from Thompson and Cumberbatch below into a brief summary that describes how historians see this period as important. I need a copy of the Cumberbatch thesis! -->

## Politics

### Rising Black political power

<!-- Examples of spaces for Black power/activism -->

Examples include the MeDoSo Club House (the meeting place for a group of black doctors who donated generously to the NAACP) was located in a house at 1800 Eutaw Place.

These included the Smith Hotel described by the *Sun*, at the time of the demolition in July 1957, as "almost a shrine to much of Baltimore's Negro population." The hotel was built in 1912 by Thomas R. Smith and served as a "gathering place for Negro visitors from as far north as New York and as far west as Chicago."[@SmithHotelNoted1957]

Electoral politics also reemerged as a major source of opportunity for change. A few months before the 1932 election, the Afro-American helped to organize a registration drive for black voters, highlighting the fact that in Baltimore City :

>37,908 colored people are registered and ready to vote, and 54,000 of us are slackers and ineligible to cast a ballot because we have not registered.[@GiveBaltimoreNew1932]

The drive won supported from former City Council member Walter S. Emerson, leading members of the A.M.E. Church, and, one account noted, "It is expected that leaders in the Socialist and Communist groups will be invited to participate".[@WILLORGANIZENONPARTISAN1932; @REGISTRATIONORGANIZATIONLAUNCHED1932]<!-- Add more information about the City Council in this period. Add more information about statewide politics. -->

In 1934, Baltimore's black voters helped to defeat long-serving Democratic Maryland Governor Albert Ritchie in favor of Republican Harry Nice. <!-- Add information on the consequences of this election, e.g. first appointment for Black police officers. -->

In 1943, the same voters helped to defeat long-serving Democratic Mayor Howard W. Jackson in favor of Republican Theodore McKeldin. McKeldin's liberal views on civil rights won him significant support from black voters who including many registered by the NAACP in the group's "Vote for Victory" drive.[@MinistersUrgeNew1943] Reverend Marion Bascom, a Civil Rights activist and leader of Douglas Memorial Community Church, later reflected on how as Mayor and later Governor Theodore McKeldin was accessible to activists:

>People didn't have to have a 'sit-in' demonstration to see Mr. McKeldin. Mr. McKeldin was available and this, I think, made all the difference.[@ShoemakerWeShallOvercome1994, 262]

Support for Nice and McKeldin did not reverse the major realignment of black voters from the Republican to the Democratic Party. Black voters in northern cities were key to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's reelection in 1936 and 1940. In a column on Roosevelt's 1936 election, African American mathematician and writer [Kelly Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Miller_(scientist)) celebrated the end of the "Solid South" control over the Democratic party and called  a "victory of liberalism over reaction."<!-- Add transition on shift from support for white to Black candidates. -->

![Baltimore City Council, January 21, 1957. Courtesy Enoch Pratt Free Library, Digital Maryland, [mdaa306](http://collections.digitalmaryland.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/mdaa/id/314/rec/1119)](https://baltimoreheritage.github.io/civil-rights-heritage/assets/images/mdaa306.jpeg)

The Colored Women's Democratic Campaign Committee organized by Victorine Q. Adams (1912–2006) in December 1946 and regular voter registration campaigns by the NAACP in the 1940s, led directly to the election of [Harry A. Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_A._Cole) to the Maryland State Senate in 1954 and [Verda Welcome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verda_Welcome) in 1962. Cole was first African American ever elected to the Maryland Senate and Welcome was the first black woman to be elected to any state senate in the country—key victories for African Americans seeking change through representation in local and state government. However, these victories also reflected a city where African Americans made up a growing share of the electorate as white residents fled to the suburbs.

In 1966, CORE's announcement of the "Baltimore Target City Project" attracted national media attention. Although the project failed to deliver on CORE's ambitious announcement, the nation's focus on inequality in Baltimore pushed McKeldin to establish the Mayor's Task Force for Civil Rights (also known as the Baltimore Community Relations Commission) focused on taking action on housing, public accommodations, employment, health and welfare, police-community relations, and education.[@McKeldinStateMayorTheodore1966]

### Interracial activism

Finally, spaces for organizing, community building, and mutual support continued to be an important resource for both white and black activists. One example is Levering Hall at the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University. In 1953, Chester Wickwire accepted a position as the executive secretary of the campus YMCA and the chaplain for the university. At Levering Hall, Wickwire provided "a haven for liberals on an otherwise conservative campus" and ran "ran various student life programs such as concerts, dances, and movie screenings while simultaneously organizing political discussions about civil rights, pacifism, the Cold War, and Vietnam." Wickwire himself was an active participant in the Civil Rights movement and helped support student activists.<!-- Citation missing! Oral history? -->

### White reaction in politics

Between 1950 and 1960, the population of Baltimore County grew by over 80% (from 270,273 to 492,428). In the same ten year period, Baltimore City lost population (dropping from 949,708  to 939,024) while the proportion of African American residents grew (23.70% to 34.67%). Between 1960 and 1970, the population of Baltimore County continue to grow (26.12% to 621,077). Between 1950 and 1970, the population of Anne Arunel County, the population grew by more than 250% (117,392 in 1950 to 206,634 in 1960 to 297,539 in 1970).


Racialized suburban growth, or "white flight", functioned as an implicit strategy of white resistance to integration. White resistance also included more explicit and, at times, violent responses by white people who sought to maintain the status quo and supported elected  officials who ran on their opposition to the Civil Rights movement. White Baltimoreans in the city and suburbs voted in support of [George C. Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace) (the segregationist Democratic Governor of Alabama) in the 1964 Democratic primary and for Barry Goldwater (a Republican Senator and opponent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) in that year's general election. Hundreds of white residents attended segregationist rallies organized by the [National States' Rights Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_States%27_Rights_Party) in Patterson Park or Riverside Park in 1966.

In 1966, candidate [George P. Mahoney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P._Mahoney) won an upset victory in the Democratic primary for Governor (receiving around 30% of the vote). In the general election, Mahoney based his campaign on his opposition to open housing with the slogan "Your home is your castle; protect it."[@HardestyVeilVoodooGeorge2009; @HardestyveilvoodooGeorge2008] The controversy surrounding Mahoney's racist campaign led a third independent candidate to enter the race which ended with the election of Spiro Agnew. Mahoney may have lost the election but his significant support in the Baltimore region illustrates the scale of white opposition to desegregation in this period.

## Housing

The New Deal and World War II both led to major changes in the relationship of the city and state government to housing and transportation in Baltimore. During the Great Depression, the shortage of new homes for both white and black buyers kept existing homeowners fixed in place and stopped the process of racial transition that had been underway in west and east Baltimore neighborhoods from the 1880s through the 1920s.

The lines of segregation were further reinforced by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) (established in 1933) which used infamous "red-lining" maps to discourage lending in neighborhoods where African Americans lived. The [National Housing Act of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Housing_Act_of_1934) created the Federal Housing Administration and the [Housing Act of 1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_Act_of_1937) provided a new source of federal funding for cities like Baltimore to engage in "slum clearance" and build new public housing projects. The federal government continued to shape housing policy after WWII with the approval of the Housing Act of 1949 on July 15, 1949.

These policy changes, and the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of *[Shelley v. Kraemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_v._Kraemer)* ending the legal enforcement of racial covenants shaped changes in the areas of:

- Public housing beginning in the late 1930s
- Private housing beginning in the mid-1940s through racial transition and "white flight"
- Transportation and land use policies that had a discriminatory affect on black neighborhoods

Across the country, housing starts dropped by over 90% from a high of 937,000 in 1925 to 93,000 in 1933.[@HaywardBaltimoreRowhouse2001, 155]

During the Great Depression, West Baltimore's "color line" had stabilized around Fulton Avenue. Beginning in the late 1940s, however, neighborhoods at the edge of Old West Baltimore began to transition from white to black. The change was driven by a number of factors including the rapid growth of Baltimore’s African American population during the 1940s and 1950s, the intense overcrowding and deteriorating housing conditions within historically segregated African American neighborhoods, and the movement of white households out of the center city to the areas of new development in the Baltimore suburbs.

From January 1941 to November 1941 alone, housing vacancies for units open to African American occupancy shrank from .8% to .1%. In a letter to Mayor McKeldin in July 1945, in response to the efforts by a group of 350 residents in the Fulton Avenue area to prevent black residents from moving west, the NAACP argued "growth demands that we take in those streets that fringe our area since every attempt to enter new sections is vigorously denied." The Citizens Committee for Justice and the Baltimore Urban League observed "the need for more housing is most sharply felt in the Negro community, where there are virtually no vacancies of any type."[@MayorDiscussesNegro1945]

An October 1948 editorial in the Baltimore Sun described the "colored section of most cities" as "already dangerously overcrowded" and noted that only 2% of new housing built in 1948 was open to African Americans, despite representing 20% of Baltimore’s total population.[@SmallProportionNew1948] By 1950, Baltimore had 226,053 black residents, representing 23.8% of the population but occupying only 19.4% of dwelling units. This pattern continued into the early 1950s: of the 53,000 permits issued new homes in Baltimore metropolitan area from 1950 to 1953, only 3,200 of those were open to African American households, even as the black population increased another 10%.

### Racial transition and "white flight"

When African American residents began responding to this housing crisis by purchasing homes in formerly segregated white neighborhoods some white resident met them with violence. In 1945, a group of people, described by the *Baltimore Afro American* as "hoodlums who resented having the Millers move into a white neighborhood," threw bricks at the home of James Miller and his family at 816 N. Fulton Avenue, breaking glass in the front door and windows.[@FultonAvenueHome1945] The newspaper expanded on this account writing:

> Of at least fifty houses on Fulton Avenue now owned by colored persons between the 500 and 1800 blocks, only one case of violence has been reported by one of the three families now known to occupy homes there. The James Miller family, which moved into 816 N. Fulton Avenue on February 15, reported that bricks were thrown through a window and door panel on the following Saturday. The second floor of this house is occupied by the William Montgomery family… Among Fulton Avenue property owners are the Rev. Hiram J. Smith, Dr. Bruce Alleyne and the Medicos Club, an organization of physicians and dentists. "For Sale" signs may be seen all along Fulton Avenue.[@50HomesOwned1945]

In August 1948, a house on the 1300 block of Payson Street just to the north of the district was subject to an arson attempt, attributed to retaliation against a white Jewish home-owner who had "broken" the block by selling a property to an African American homeowner in 1946.[@RacialHatredBlamed1948] In July 1950 after Ms. Beatrice Sessoms, a native of North Carolina who came to Baltimore two years earlier, moved with her nephew to the 2300 block of Lauretta Avenue, her house was attacked.[@HomeBuyerStanding1950] Dr. Ed Orser quotes one black West Baltimore resident recalling the experience of white flight in the late 1940s:

> Black people started moving out of the confined areas somewhere around 1947 or 1948, but what would happen was that whites would evacuate a block or two blocks, and black people would move in. The evacuation would take place first. I remember streets like Fulton Avenue, Monroe Street—they were once totally white, and they went through the transition and changed somewhere between 1946 and 1949—that was the time I was in service. When I went in, there were no black people when I came out, there they were black streets… But it wasn’t integration… it was an evacuation.[@OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994, 68]

These initial movements soon accelerated, particularly in west and northwest areas of Baltimore. Lula Jones Garrett, a columnist for the _Baltimore Afro_, observed in a column titled "Change-the-Address New Game on Baltimore Front" writing:

> What with the local yokels forsaking the ghettos and moving into swankier mansions, it takes a special edition of the directory to locate your best friends these days."[@GarrettChangetheAddressNewGame1949]

The process of this rapid transition is closely associated with negative accounts of realtors or "block-busters" using a range of tactics to take advantage of both white sellers and black buyers. For example, during the 1940s and 1950s many African American households purchased home under land-installment contracts or buy-like-rent arrangements, also known as lease option contracts, that allowed home-owners to purchase property without an initial down payment or closing charges. However, these arrangements did not immediately transfer title to the property and the contract could still be terminated if the new home-owner missed a single payment. Although the black home-ownership rate rose by 194% between 1940 and 1950, in comparison to 58.8% for whites, a 1955 survey by the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations found that 53% of their respondents had purchased their homes through such arrangements rather than regular financing.[@OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994, 91] <!-- This citation doesn't include the increase in homeownership rates although it may be on another page of Orser. -->

According to an interview with Antero Pietella, in 1947, Thomas Cripps witnessed a man with suit in the area around his home at 2323 Mosher Street carrying signs "This House is Not for Sale," with the implication that the neighborhood was imminently threatened with transition. Cripps' family became the first household on the block to sell their property to a black family when they sold their home in 1949 to Ellsworth F. Davage, a Baltimore County school teacher, and his wife Elizabeth.[@PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010, 102-103]

Although Baltimore evidently avoided widespread physical violence on a scale comparable to white antagonists in Detroit or Chicago, the State Commission on Interracial Problems observed in 1958, "The problem it said, is not with violence 'but with the frigid withdrawal' of whites from the Negroes." During the late 1950s, the State Commission and others finally engaged with the ongoing process of racial transition with the beginning of advocacy and organizing efforts to promote "neighborhood stabilization."[@NEGROGAINSSEEN1958]

<!-- Section from 1954-1968 -->

The issue reached Edmondson Village around 1955, when the first black residents moved west of the Gwynns Falls to live in the southeast corner of the region, around the western end of the Baltimore Street Bridge. One white resident remarked on the experience, commenting to Dr. Ed Orser:

> When the [black] people started moving into the neighborhood, they did come in, literally block by block. I can recall when they came across the… bridge, everybody was very upset; they said, "Oh my God, they're over the bridge now; our street will be next."[@OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994]<!-- Missing page number -->

In April 1958, the improvement group organized their annual meeting at School No. 88 located at Wildwood Parkway and Gelston Drive, hosting Chief Judge Delany Foster of the Orphans Court of Baltimore as the guest speaker. In July 1958, Association president L.E. Larsen gave the association's support to a plan sponsored by the Baltimore Urban League, the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations, and the Citizens Planning and Housing Association to "combat the conversion of Baltimore areas from all-white to all-Negro occupancy." Larsen observed that Edmondson Village:

> already faced with pressure from block-busting realtor tactics and population shifts… the exodus from the city of the stable core of responsible citizens will likely be accelerated and the inevitable consequences will be a set-back to many of the long-range plans now being developed and implemented.[@POPULATIONSHIFTFOUGHT1958]

An African American resident in this period later shared her experience in an oral history with Dr. Ed Orser, remarking:

> When we first moved to the neighborhood, it was more white – we were just about the second black family on this block... We could see the changes, because when we moved, there were so many sale signs all around, and it did make a difference in the neighborhood, because there was a change, and you had to get yourself adjusted to the people who were moving in, and you couldn't really know the ones who were moving out, because they were leaving so fast, so we were really going through a transitional stage. People were moving in and out overnight; you didn't really know who your neighbors were. It was a difficult period, because when we moved, we thought maybe the neighborhood would be stabilized; it just wasn't.[@OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994, 151]

By 1960, however, the area south of Edmondson Village had changed from more than 99% white in 1950 to 62% black in 1960 and, a decade later, 92% black in 1970. Edmondson Village itself remained 99% white in 1960 but had changed to 97% black by 1970.[@OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994] <!-- Missing page number -->

Although Baltimore did not see widespread physical violence on a scale comparable to white antagonists in Detroit or Chicago, the State Commission on Interracial Problems observed in 1958, "The problem it said, is not with violence 'but with the frigid withdrawal' of whites from the Negroes." During the late 1950s, the State Commission and others finally engaged with the ongoing process of racial transition with the beginning of advocacy and organizing efforts to promote "neighborhood stabilization." <!-- Missing citation -->

### Public housing

Edgar Allan Poe Homes (built 1938) and McCulloh Homes (built 1940)—two of the earliest public housing projects for African Americans.

### Urban renewal, transportation, and land use

The issue of highway construction and the disparate impact of highway construction on black neighborhoods began to take shape in this period. At the most basic level, white households were more likely to own cars than African American households.<!-- FIXME: Citation needed! -->

A series of road building and widening projects in the 1930s and 1940s brought increased noise and automotive traffic to largely black neighborhoods. Examples include the construction of the Howard Street extension and bridge over the Jones Falls in 1938 (displacing a large number African American households) and the initial expansion of Druid Lake Drive in 1947 (Druid Lake Drive expanded again in 1964 despite significant opposition from nearby residents).[@WatmoughHowardStSteel1938; @DestructionDruidHill1947] In 1948, the NAACP sued to try to stop the conversion of Druid Hill Avenue and McCulloh Street into one-way streets but was unsuccessful in reversing the move.[@CourtAskedHalt1948]

The most notable of the proposed road projects in this period was the 1944 plan for an east-west highway prepared by New York planner Robert Moses. The plan would have required the demolition of two hundred city blocks and nineteen hundred residents but Moses suggested, "Nothing which we propose to remove will constitute any loss to Baltimore."[@PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010, 219] Moses argued that the demolition of "slums" was a benefit as "the more of them that are wiped out the healthier Baltimore will be in the long run."[@LiebWhitemanlane2011, 56]

<!-- From 1954-1968 -->

In 1956, the state selected the Mount Royal area as an urban renewal site for the development of the State Center office complex.

<!-- According to [Indyreader](https://indyreader.org/content/history-housing-policy-and-segregation-baltimore)

> In the period between 1950 and 1964, Baltimore embarked on an aggressive urban renewal program that displaced more than 25,000 people, 85% of them African-American.  In 1953, the City's Redevelopment Commission designated eight areas of the city to be redeveloped, including urban renewal projects in Waverly and the area just west of Johns Hopkins Hospital.  In Waverly, a residential and commercial project that included 290 apartments and 270 parking spaces was designated by the Redevelopment Commission for white occupants only. -->

## Public Accommodations

Downtown department stores had special sigificance as "some of Baltimore's most prominent sites of civic culture and modernity" whiched helped make them a target for anti-racist protests from the 1930s through the 1960s.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003]<!-- Missing page number -->

Between 1938 and 1940, the Baltimore Urban League and NAACP joined in private  negotiations with downtown department store owners and seeking to end their discriminatory policies against African American shoppers.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 43] Civil Rights leaders met again with a representative of the Retail Merchants Association in February 1943.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 48]  In 1945, the *Afro-American* newspaper made a public push for change by naming specific downtown stores as "Orchids" or "Onions" depending on their treatment of African American shoppers.[@FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998]<!-- Missing page numbers. --> The 1930s and 1940s also saw legal and activist efforts to desegregation Baltimore's public parks and recreational facilities.

However, the *Brown* decision pushed these issues to the forefront of the local debate and encouraged the years of activism that followed. The link between the Brown decision and the integration of public facilities stands out clearly in the opinion by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, *[Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Dawson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_and_City_Council_of_Baltimore_v._Dawson)* (1955):

> it is obvious that racial segregation in recreational activities can no longer be sustained as a proper exercise of the police power of the State; for if that power cannot be invoked to sustain racial segregation in the schools, where attendance is compulsory...it cannot be sustained with respect to public beach and bathhouse facilities, the use of which is entirely optional.[@Schustercityswingset2011, 114]

The major areas of activism include:

- Public parks and recreational facilities (such as pools and recreation centers)
- Theaters, stores, and other private businesses open to the public
- Transportation facilities (passenger railroad and ferries)

### Parks and recreation

Baltimore's growing African American population made it more difficult in the 1930s for Baltimore City to sustain segregation for the city's parks and recreational facilities.[@KirschMunicipalGolfCivil2007; @WellsSeparateEqualDesegregating2008; @BaidyaroyBlacksGolfEmerging2011]

For example, in September 1934, the Carroll Park golf course partly opened to African American golfers but limited black players to specific days maintaining separation from white players through staggered play. In 1938, two black golfers Dallas Nicholas and William I. Gosnell sued Baltimore City to try to overturn this policy but were unsuccessful.[@WellsSeparateEqualDesegregating2008] <!-- TODO: Find more details about this suit. --><!-- Citation missing page number. -->

On December 17, 1947, a group of white and black young people organized an integrated youth basketball game at Garrison Junior High School to protest segregationist policies. This pattern of interracial protest continued on July 11, 1948 when a group of young black and white tennis players organized a game on the tennis courts at Druid Hill Park. The protest led to a lawsuit against the city, Boyer v. Garrett (1949), that resulted in the court overturning the city's long-standing policy of racial segregation in city parks.[@ChesnutBoyerGarrett1949]

Emboldened by this success, in 1950, a group of African American activists attempted to purchase tickets for the beach at [Fort Smallwood Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Smallwood_Park) a popular recreational park located in Anne Arundel County but owned and managed by Baltimore City. <!-- TODO: What happened when they tried to buy tickets? -->

Finally, in 1953, Governor Theodore McKeldin opened all state parks to African Americans.
 <!-- TODO: What does it mean that the state parks were open? Was this in practice or just in law only? -->

### Theaters and stores

Many downtown department stores refused to allow black shoppers to try on clothes, return clothes after a purchase, or provide service to black shoppers at all. In addition, store restaurants and lunch counters refused to seat African American diners offering them take out service or no service at all. In 1945 , the _Afro-American_ newspaper began the "Orchid and Onion" campaign to celebrate stores that did not discrimination against black shopper ("Orchids") and shame downtown department stores with discriminatory policies ("Onions").[@FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998, 183]

Black people faced similar policies of separation and discrimination at local theaters as well as stores. In addition, theaters often refused to book black musicians and performers. On February 1, 1948, the Baltimore police arrested a group of Morgan State College students for picketing Ford's Theater on Fayette Street. The students and other activists soon returned and continued a five year campaign to end segregated seating at Ford's Theater. Finally, in 1953, Ford's Theatre ended segregated seating. After the Lyric Theatre on Mt. Royal Avenue refused to allow singer and activist Marian Anderson to perform, Baltimore's Commission on Human Relations intervened and persuaded the theatre owners to allow Marian Anderson to appear in January 1954. Despite this progress, however, most hotels and restaurants remained segregated so, after the performance, Sidney Hollander, Sr. hosted an afternoon reception with Anderson at his home. <!-- TODO: Where did Sidney Hollander, Sr. live? Bolton Hill or Windsor Hills?-->

<!-- Public accomodations section from 1954-1968 -->

The discrimination African Americans faced in public accommodations was not just one of simple exclusion. Historian Paul A. Kramer notes that the discriminatory "racial practices" at Baltimore's downtown department stores included three main aspects:

1. Discrimination in employment (only hired as maitenance or stockroom workers, elevator operators, porters, and restroom attendants; not higher-paying, higher-status jobs)
2. Refusal to serve African American customers at lunch counters
3. Policies prohibiting African American customers from trying on or returning clothing

The prohibition on returns from African American customers (known as the "final sale" policy) reveals one of the fundamental motivation behind racial segregation: "anxieties and fears about physical contact between whites and blacks". Kramer continues:

> For most whites, blacks represented sources of unspecified physical and moral pollution ... Black and white boadies might "touch" in the exchange of forks and plates at store lunch-counters. Even more threatening to whites was the possibility that the clothes they tried on or purchased might bear an invisible taint of black physical contact.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 41]

Notably, in early 1943, when the Baltimore NAACP sought to overturn the state's Jim Crow laws, the repeal bill they supported was sent to state legislature *Hygine Committee* rather than *Judiciary Committee*  for consideration.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 42]

One early challenge to these segregationist policies came in 1953 with an interracial group of CORE activists using sit-ins to protest segregated lunch counters (a strategy used previously in New York City in 1939 and by other CORE activists in Chicago in 1942). The success of their efforts was noted in the regular column of Mrs. B.M. Phillips (“If You Ask Me”) in the Afro-American Newspaper on November 7, 1953:

> Thanks to the Committee On Racial Equality, (CORE), the Urban league, and the Americans for Democratic Action, (ADA), more stores in the 200 block W. Lexington st. are realizing there is no color line in the dollars you spend. Lunch counters and restaurants in the Kresge and Woolworth Five and Ten have been serving all customers for several weeks. McCrory's has just reversed its policy and will serve all comers […] Schulte United in the 200 block Lexington is still acting silly.[@PhillipsIfYouAsk1953]

The success, however, was limited. One 1955 survey found that 91% of 191 randomly-selected Baltimore businesses reported either the "exclusion" or "segregation" of blacks.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 38] The annual report of the Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations also provided updates on discriminatory policies listing "places of public accommodations [that] are open to all" in March 1958.

As Phillips alludes in her column, the issue of public accomodation was often presented in terms of consumer politics. This made the issue personal for middle-class black activists like Mrs. Madeline W. Murphy who wrote to the Vice President of Hoschild Kohn in 1956 to say "not only [do I] feel equal to the average Hochschild Kohn's consumers but I feel superior to them." Such emphasis on racial equality as individual access made the desegregation of public accommodations "less of a challenge to traditional notions of racial equality" (in contrast to education, employment, and voting rights) and helped secure the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.[@SalvatoreCivilRightsAmerica2004, 82]

CORE's downtown campaign faded after the successful desegregation of the Read's Drug Store lunch counter in January 1955. A new movement of students took up the cause on March 26, 1960 when black student activists from Morgan State University attempted to purchase food at department store restaurants at the Northwood Shopping Center and downtown. The student's tried to purchase lunch at four downtown department stores. The succeeded at Hochschild Kohn; Sewart's shut their food counters to all customers, white and black; Hutzler's refused to serve a group of twenty students who waited for three hours before leaving.

The sit-ins continued through April 17, 1960, Easter Sunday when the *Sun* reported that Albert D. Hutzler met with Furman Templeton from the Urgan League, along with activists David Glenn and Robert B. Watts. After the meeting, Hutzler announced: "We have lifted restrictions. Negroes will be served in our restaurants." Hecht-May and other downtown stores followed Hoschild Kohn and Hutzler's with the change.

A large collection of letters sent to Hoschild Kohn after their policy change in late March 1960 reflect attitudes to desegration in the period. Interestingly, there are ten times the number of letters in support of integration but that is likely because activists saw the urgency of continuing the policy and saw integration as "frighteningly reversible." Some opponents of desegregation described a rationale of "consumer choice", as one woman wrote:

> Do you realize that by so doing [integrating], you are taking from the White Race any choice they had of segregation or integration when dining outside of their homes?[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 54]

Others threatened to stay away from the downtown store, now that the policy of segregation had been abandoned. Paul Kramer notes:

> more than one of the racist critics wrote as self-conscious suburbanites, warning the downtown that integration would further provoke the flight of white residences and businesses. In the process, they revealed the extent to which the suburbs were imagined as racial islands still free of black "invasion": downtown segregation was the only remaining draw that could pull whites in from their comfortable, newly-designed racial enclaves.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 55]

Notably, department stores had their own role in the suburban exodus with Hutzler's stores in Towson (1952), Eastpoint (1956), Westview (1958); and Hoschild Kohn's in Edmondson Village (1947).<!-- Citation missing! I think this is sourced from Orser. --> Civil Rights supporters also saw the importance of suburbanization in shaping the debate over public accomodation. In August 1957, a column in the *Afro* noted:

> The big downtown stores and business have not welcomed colored people in the past... Their white only customers have moved to the suburbs and the colored customers they spurned are moving out too. So the heart of the city is no longer Lexington and Howard Sts.[@PhillipsIfYouAsk1957] <!-- FIXME: Double-check the citation above -->

Around the United States, the push for public accomodations continued in the 1950s, as a 2004 report from the National Historic Landmarks program describes:

> During the 1950s, a number of northern and western states adopted legislation prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations. Joining the eighteen states with such laws already on the books were Oregon (1953), Montana (1955), New Mexico (1955), Vermont (1957), Maine (1957), Idaho (1959), and Alaska (1959). In 1961, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming brought the total number of states with anti-segregations statutes up to twenty-eight. In addition, several cities in states that did not have public accommodations laws passed their own versions, including Wilmington, Delaware; Baltimore, Maryland; St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri; and El Paso, Texas. [@SalvatoreCivilRightsAmerica2004, 50]

In Baltimore, the City Council passed legislation ending segregated public accommodations in 1962.[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 373] Maryland followed with a state law in January 1963.[@SalvatoreCivilRightsAmerica2004, 64] In late February 1964, the NAACP supported the Baltimore City Public Accommodations and Fair Employment Practice Ordinances which "guaranteed an end to lawful discrimination in 'employment practices, educational institutions, places of public accommodation, resort or amusement, and health and welfare agencies.'"[@ShoemakerWeShallOvercome1994, 265]<!-- NOTE: It is unclear if this is different legislation than the 1962 law (or if the 1962 date referenced in Thompson is an error). -->

<!-- 

### Transportation facilities

FIXME: Add information on:

- Morgan v. Virginia
- February 15, 1951, Maryland legislature ends segregation on trains and boats

For transportation, as well, the *Brown* decision was consequential. On November 7, 1955, the Interstate Commerce Commission similarly responded on the *Brown* decsion with the announcement that the "separate but equal doctrine was dead with respect to interstate transportation."[@SalvatoreCivilRightsAmerica2004, 44] The 1956 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in [Browder v. Gayle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browder_v._Gayle) upheld a lower court's decision to prohibit segregation on *intrastate* as well as interstate transportation under the Fourteenth Amendment.[@SalvatoreCivilRightsAmerica2004, 46]

... -->

## Education

The issues of education and employment are not only intertwined in the present but were also clearly understood as closely related issues by Civil Rights activists in this period.

- Equality for segregated black schools
- Desegregation for students and educators

### School equality before Brown

<!-- Add section introduction! Needs more information on the national/statewide context Weren't there more high schools opening in this period? -->

African American school administrator Francis Wood continued to use build on the changes suggested by the Strayer school survey in the early 1920s. Between 1929 and 1940, Wood increased attendance for black elementary and junior high school students to above 85% and above 90% for black high school students.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 44]<!-- What were white school administrators saying in this period?-->

Wood also worked at the national level serving as the president of the Association for Colored School Teachers "which fought for better schools and equality.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 47]<!-- How did it fight? --> However, Wood's investment in segregated schools may have come with an accommodationist perspective as Wood "warned African Americans that now was not the time to demand undue advantages."[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 48] <!-- FIXME: Date? Source? -->

On April 9, 1942, Dr. Carl Murphy, acting as chairman of the Baltimore Citizens Committee for Justice, sent a letter to Mayor Howard Jackson arguing for the appointment of an African American person to the school board.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 50] Where prior efforts had failed, this one succeeded<!-- Is this because of the 1942 March on Annapolis?--> with the 1944 appointment of George F. W. McMechen, a 1895 graduate from Morgan College and an African American lawyer, to the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 51]<!-- NOTE: Was this also related to the Commission on the Problems Affecting the Negro Population? -->

<!-- Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (built 1913 – now the central office for the Baltimore City Public Schools) at North Avenue and Calvert Street which began to desegregate on a limited basis in 1952. --><!-- Check this! -->

### School desegregation before Brown

Even as Francis Wood, along with many black teachers and families, advocated for improvements to black schools within the segregated system, others fought to end school segregation at every level from elementary schools to universities.

The best known case in this period was [Murray v. Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_v._Pearson) (1935) where Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston won Donald Gaines Murray the right to attend the University of Maryland School of Law. The court:

>noted the state's requirement under the Fourteenth Amendment, as it was understood at that time, to provide substantially an equal treatment in the facilities it provides from public funds. Since Maryland chose to only provide one law school for use by students in the state, that law school had to be available to all races.<!-- Citation missing! -->

In the late 1940s, Carl Murphy and Juanita Jackson Mitchell began pushing to desegregate Baltimore public schools and, in 1952, the NAACP and Thurgood Marshall successfully forced the city permit a small group of African American students to enroll at the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute.[@BaumBrownBaltimore2011, 155; @TempletonAdmissionNegroBoys1954; @ThomsenIntegrationBaltimorePolytechnic1983]

<!-- Add information on Universities. -->

In 1947, Dr. Ralph J. Young became the first African American to join teaching staff at Johns Hopkins Hospital and, in 1950, Frederick I. Scott becomes the first African American to graduate from Johns Hopkins University. That same year, Juanita Jackson Mitchell becomes the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Maryland Law School. In 1951, Hiram Whittle became the first black undergraduate to enroll at the University of Maryland and, on August 1, 1952, Polytechnic High School opened to African American students on a limited basis.[@TempletonAdmissionNegroBoys1954] <!-- NOTE: See @seawright_desgregation_1970 on the Donald Murray Case. -->

### School integration after Brown

<!-- This section feels disjointed and thin on details. -->

Unlike many other Southern cities and other jurisdictions in Maryland, the Baltimore City School Board, chaired by Walter Sondheim, responded quickly to the 1954 Supreme Court decision in  [Brown v. Board of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v.Board_of_Education) by announcing a plan to end legal segregation. In contrast to the ["massive resistance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_resistance) seen elsewhere, representatives of nineteen "civic, religious, educational and labor groups" came together to form the Coordinating Council for Civic Unity and support the "peaceful opening of schools." The city continued the long-standing policy of "open-enrollement" (where any student could attend any school) but dropped the requirement that Black students attend segregated "colored schools."

Although the move won praise at the time, historian Howard Baum notes the critical flaw in the plan: "Explicitly, [the school board] would not discriminate against black children; implicitly, neither would it act on their behalf."[@BaumBrownBaltimore2011, 155] For white families, the policy likely "added to racial anxiety", as Baum notes:

> Parents could not know what a school's makeup would be when classes started.... This uncertainty not only added to anxiety but also made leaving city public schools a choice with a more predictable outcome."[@BaumBrownBaltimore2011, 172]<!-- Using this quote along seems to privilege the experience of white parents above Black students. -->

![White supremacist leader Bryant Bowles at rally against school desegregation in Baltimore, 1954 October 5. Courtesy [Washington Area Spark/Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/washington_area_spark/32600844591/)](https://baltimoreheritage.github.io/civil-rights-heritage/assets/images/1954-10-05-bryant-bowles-washington_area_spark.jpg)

But within a few years, after 1954, there were two trends in enrollment. The first was the slow growing<!--Word choice?--> but moderate racial integration of city schools. The second was the school district's transition from majority white to a majority Black student enrollment.[@BaumBrownBaltimore2011, 156] By 1960, a majority of students in Baltimore's school district were black. One-third of Black students now attended formerly white schools but many students still attended segregated schools.

In 1963, a group of white and Black parents, known as 28 Parents, presented a report to the school board describing how students continued to experience *de facto* segregation. The activists identified three contributing factors:

- The construction of new schools in racially segregated neighborhoods; making a segregated student population more likely
- The preference for enrolling neighborhood children when schools were "overcrowded"; again reinforcing existing patterns of segregation
- Administrative actions to discourage integration. Baum notes, "Some white principals encouraged white parents to transfer their children out when black enrollment grew. Some principals reject black transfer applications to predominantly white schools."

Even within integrated schools, "ability tracking" separated black and white students within the building. The 28 Parents report highlighted a disturbing reality for Civil Rights activists:

> After a decade of legal segregation, most children attended class with majorities of their own race... By the time the board ended practices that limited choices, the desegregation policy had a ten-year history associated in the public mind with continuing segregation."[@BaumBrownBaltimore2011, 158]<!-- Is this a quote from Baum or from the 28 Parents report? Citation is confusing. --> 

Finally, the [1964 Civil Rights Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Civil_Rights_Act) created a federal interest in desegregating schools encouraging the city to take further action. In 1966, Mayor McKeldin's Task Force for Equal Rights began developing a plan for further action on school desegregation. His successor, Mayor  [Thomas D'Alesandro III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_D%27Alesandro_III), named Baltimore "Education City, USA" to highlight his commitment to supporting integrated and desirable schools. 

## Employment

In 1949, the Baltimore City Medical Society, a local professional association for doctors, voted to admit African American members.

From July 14 to July 16 1961, members of the Student Non-Violence Coordinating Committee (including representatives from all sixteen Southern states and Washington, D.C.) met at the Prince Hall Masonic Temple to begin planning a campaign "to presuade utility companies in the South to discontinue discrimination in employment."[@NEGROESSEEUTILITIES1961] In Baltimore, student members of the local NAACP chapter organized pickets at the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company and the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company<!-- Where exactly? --> to call for equitable hiring of African Americans.[@NEGROSTUDENTSPICKET1961]<!-- I'm inferring from the context here. --> 

<!-- Example of cultural workers. Does this belong here? -->

Another example is the Arena Playhouse at 801 McCulloh Street occupied by the Arena Players, an African American theatre troupe, since 1962. Established in 1953 as an outgrowth of the "The Negro Little Theater", the Arena Players spent a decade performing at varied locations including Coppin State University, the Druid Hill YMCA, the Great Hall Theater of St. Mary's Church in Walbrook, and the Carl J. Murphy Auditorium at Morgan State University. After securing a long-term performance space, the Arena Players acquired the building in 1969 and through the 1970s continued to serve "as one of the only venues dedicated to showcasing the works of black playwrights and performers."[@ArenaPlayersIncorporatedHistoryArenaPlayers]

Three major themes:

- Public relief for black workers and families
- Organizing industrial black workers
- Public employment for black workers

### Public relief for Black families

<!-- Needs an introduction talking about the role of public relief as a Civil Rights issue. Double-check that this period doesn't run into the early history of the welfare rights movement. Add in context on the national history of relief, welfare, and welfare rights. -->

![African American women and children receiving aid from the Baltimore Emergency Relief Commission photographed at home in their kitchen, 1934. Courtesy [Enoch Pratt Free Library, Enoch Barker Collection, Digital Maryland, mdaa152](http://collections.digitalmaryland.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/mdaa/id/195/rec/1030). ](https://baltimoreheritage.github.io/civil-rights-heritage/assets/images/mdaa152.jpeg)

 In 1934, 13% of Baltimore whites and 40% of Baltimore blacks were on relief (?) according to a study by the Baltimore Urban League.<!-- Completely duplicative with the passage below. --> While the federal government’s New Deal programs brought some relief, discrimination persisted even in the administration of these programs. The _Afro-American_ reported that an African American household with eight people recieved $8.94 a week for food but a white household of the same size recieved $12.70.[@FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998, 92-98]

Roderick Ryon notes:

> City relief was distributed by the Family Welfare Association, which reported in 1934 that 40 per cent of the city's blacks, compared to 13 per cent of its whites, were on relief. The Urban League and a local association of the unemployed, studied 150 white and black relief cases in the same year and discovered that black families typically received smaller relief sums and were removed from relief rosters before whites.[@RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980, 19]

 <!-- TODO: I read something related to the Urban League that referenced the depression beginning for black people in Baltimore around 1926. I'm sure that would be a pattern found in other cities if it is accurate. -->

<!-- More on unemployment/job loss during the Depressio? Overall figures on poverty? Look for more information in Skontes (2012) and Argersinger (2017). -->

### Organizing Black industrial workers

![Manpower: Negro bomber plant workers, 1942. U.S. Office of War Information. Courtesy New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture Photographs and Prints Division](https://baltimoreheritage.github.io/civil-rights-heritage/assets/images/nypl.digitalcollections.510d47de-8195-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99.001.w.jpg)

<!-- Missing transition! Look for information from the initial Urban League report on discrimination by local industry. -->

In the 1930s, African American activists put growing pressure on public and private employers to end segregated hiring and begin offering more opportunities to African American workers. This pressure included both a renewed legal efforts backed by the NAACP at the local and national level and a series of grass-roots protest actions organized by activist groups like CORE, inter-religious coalitions like the Baltimore Council of Churches, and by students (especially from Morgan State College).

White unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor continued to exclude black workers. The loss of and were subject to the policy of "last hired and first fired" leading to widespread job loss.

<!-- TODO: What proportion of black workers were employed in the service sector? How did employment opportunities vary by gender? Could this be a good place to talk about employment for blind or deaf workers? Or about black entrepreneurship? --><!-- Look for information about AFL and CIO union membership in Baltimore -->

<!-- TODO: There must have been more going on for black workers in this period than just the CIO. I think small business ownership should also be incorporated into this section. -->

Cumberbatch also argues that by working "with both the Fair Employment Practices Committee and the CIO, civil rights leaders were able to break through racial barriers that had historically confined African Americans to the least paying and least desirable jobs."[@CumberbatchWorkingracetransformation2001]

Roderick Ryon notes:

>Numbering 144,000 in a population of 817,000 in 1930, city blacks faced greater and different kinds of problems than whites. Substantial numbers were employed in 1930, but they occupied the lowest rung of the wage ladder. Indeed low wages for adult males had forced thousands of women, adolescents and the elderly on the job market to supplement meager family incomes. Eighty- five per cent of employable black males held jobs in 1930 compared to 77 percent of native whites, and 51 per cent of employable black women were wage earners, compared to 27 per cent of native whites.[@RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980, 19]

>Thus, the low-paying domestic service offered some 26,000 jobs to Baltimore blacks in 1930,but as conditions worsened, hundreds of white employers, determined to "take care of their own" first, preferred whites over blacks. As some city industries began to recover they employed whites rather than rehire blacks, and by 1936, seventeen percent of Baltimore's employable, skilled black males were out of work.[@RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980, 19]

>Conducting a survey of 115 retail and manufacturing firms in 1933, the Urban League discovered that blacks constituted 8.3 per cent of the firm's employees in 1933, compared to 9.2 per cent in 1930[@RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980, 19]<!-- Break up these giant block quotes. -->

However, local unions, often, did little to help black Baltimoreans, as Ryon observed:

>In 1931 black longshore-men walked out of a meeting of the City Federation of Labor rather than accept Jim Crow seating. Local white unions occasionally violated or evaded even sacred commandments of labor. When black brick layers arrived in the city, union cards in hand, they were offered free train fare out of the city, not the traditional welcome of newcomers. Rather than work with black union hod-carriers,whites in the AF of L bricklayers' union used white scab labor.[@RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980, 20]

Another important supporter of reform were black professional organizations such as the Progressive Engineers Association of Maryland (organized in 1938) and the MeDeSo (a club for black physicians and dentists established by Dr. J.E.T. Camper and others in 1942).<!-- Is this the right place for this information? Should there be a separate section on professional trades? -->

In 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 which established Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) and lay a foundation for broader activism against discriminatory hiring. Such efforts were frustrated, however, by the weak support of many industrial unions for black workers and the racism of white workers. This challenge is exemplified in the example of Bethlehem Steel in 1943<!-- Check date! --> when white workers walked off the job in protest over the hiring of black workers.

<!-- How did this continue to change in the 1950s and 1960s? -->

### Opening public jobs to Black workers

An early sign of progress came in July 1937 when the Baltimore Police Department hired Violet Hill Whyte as the city's first black police officer. Whyte, however, was not a uniform officer and did not carry a gun as part of her work.

Public workers had more success in the years after World War II than some private workers. In 1945, the NAACP won a critical legal victory to end a segregated training program at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in the case of Kerr v. Enoch Pratt Free Library (1945).[@JacksonDiscriminationdeferredHow2008; @HerzogKerrPrincipleState2007] In 1953, the Baltimore City Fire Department appointed their first African American firemen.

<!-- One example of a building that was built after *Brown* but reflects this same logic of a "separate but equal" facility is the Melvin Cade National Guard Armory where the state decided to maintain a segregated black National Guard unit and, in 1960, erected a new building for the unit at 2620 Winchester Street. The new building became a civic and social center for African American residents in West Baltimore, hosting dance parties, lectures, and neighborhood meetings throughout the 1960s and 1970s. After the death of Melvin H. Cade, commanding officer of the 229th Battalion of the Maryland National Guard, in 1964, the Guard renamed the building in his honor. Baltimore City listed the Armory as a local landmark in 2009. -->

## Criminal Injustice

<!-- TODO: This section is a bit of a mess right now. I'm not sure how to distinguish this from the prior 1905-1929 period except by the emphasis on the Euel Lee case and the 1942 March on Annapolis. Maybe that is enough? -->

Lynching and criminal injustice was at the center of black organizing and advocacy around Civil Rights and racial injustice in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Such cases highlighted the important role of the Communist Party in supporting African American Civil Rights as a strategy for build supporting among African Americans broadly.

On December 4, 1931, [Matthew Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Williams_(laborer)) was lynched at Salisbury, Maryland—as the Maryland Historical Society [underbelly blog](http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2012/11/29/an-american-tragedy/) notes:

> On December 4, 1931, Matthew Williams, an African American man, shot and killed his white employer in Salisbury and then turned the gun on himself in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. That evening, a mob of more than a thousand dragged Williams from his hospital bed where he lay critically wounded, and hung him up on the courthouse lawn. His body was then dragged to the town’s African American business district, and set on fire.  The Williams murder was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882, and the first since 1911.<!-- Break this up and paraphrase.-->

On October 14, 1931, Euel Lee, known as "Orphan Jones", was arrested for the murder of a white family reportedly over a disagreement about wages. The Maryland Communist Party took Lee’s case and lawyer [Bernard Ades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Ades) successfully moved Lee’s trial to Towson in Baltimore County. Ultimately, Ades lost the case (Lee was executed on October 28, 1933) but in the process helped to combat the informal prohibition on black jurors in Baltimore County.<!-- Citation missing! -->

<!-- TODO: What is the broader significance of the Euel Lee case for jury selection and due process? -->

<!-- Insert missing transition. -->

Two years later, on October 18, 1935:

> a mob of a thousand or more people stormed into the Princess Anne jail house and hauled Armwood from his cell down to the street below. Before he was hung from a tree some distance away, Armwood was dragged through the streets, beaten, stabbed, and had one ear hacked off.  Armwood’s lifeless body was then paraded through the town, finally ending up near the town’s courthouse, where the mob doused the corpse with gasoline and set it on fire.<!-- Citation missing! --><!-- Break this up and paraphrase.-->

In 1948, for the first time in the history of Maryland, a white man was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape of a black woman.<!-- What does this mean? -->

<!-- Add information on how the courts treated rape cases involving Black women. -->

In July 1967, again according to [Baltimore Police History](http://baltimorecitypolicehistory.com/), the Baltimore City Police established the first of four "Community Relations Store Front Operations" noting: "The purpose of these centers is to reach the community on an intimate basis. This was the first such project in the Northeastern region of the United States." On a visit to Baltimore around this time, Bayard Rustin observed:

> A society that refuses to give some of its people equal rights and opportunities creates frustrations whose brunt is thrown at the police because they are the obvious protectors of an unjust order. <!-- Citation missing but I think it is from a Baltimore Community Relations Commission report, 1966 or 67-->
