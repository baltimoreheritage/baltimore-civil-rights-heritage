## Introduction

Baltimore’s urban landscape experienced major changes during the first three decades of the 20th century. Following the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904, the city rebuilt the downtown area and, in 1915, the city dedicated a new sanitary sewer system after decades of delay. In 1918, Baltimore City annexed a large area of Baltimore County spurring a rapid expansion of neighborhoods along the corridor of the city's electric streetcar system. For black Baltimoreans some things remained the same: continued discrimination against black workers, and woefully unequal conditions for black students and teachers in the city's public schools. And not all changes offered good news: black Baltimoreans fought against an aggressive effort to impose racial segregation on residential neighborhoods and struggled to get their fair share of benefits from the city's growth.

![Chart: Baltimore City total population compared to black population, 1900-1930](/civil-rights-heritage/images/baltimore-city-population-1900-1930-total-black.png)

Overall, the city's population grew from around 509,000 in 1900 to 733,826 in 1920, reaching 804,874 people by 1930. The city's black population grew from 79,739 in 1900 to 84,749 in 1910 to 108,322 in 1920 and 142,106 in 1930.^[U.S. Census, 1900; 1910; 1920; 1930.] In the antebellum period, most of the new black migrants to Baltimore came from Maryland or Virginia — a pattern that continued into the early 20th century. In 1910, 87% of the black population in Baltimore was native to Maryland. Of the 13% born outside of the state, migrants from Virginia made up 8.7% of the total. This pattern set Baltimore apart from other large cities with a growing black population in the early 20th century. For example, in 1920, 76% of Baltimore's black population was native to Maryland, in comparison to Detroit's 8.4% or Manhattan's 20.9%. By 1930, the proportion of native Marylanders diminished so 59.4% of Baltimore's black residents (142,106 people) were born in the state (a modest decline of 17.1% since 1910).[@reich_baltimore_2014, 18]

<!-- TODO: Write about economic challenges during this period, e.g. Panic of 1901, Panic of 1903, economic downturn following WWI, and the start of the Great Depression -->

<!-- TODO: Add more information about the annexation and how it affected the city. Find 1920 and 1930 data for black population growth. -->

The growth of racially segregated suburbs at the edges of the city, formal and informal policies of clearance and containment to promote the isolation of black neighborhoods, and the segregated condition of Baltimore's public schools all contributed to the increasing concentration of Baltimore's black population in northwest Baltimore. At present, many buildings with important associations to this period of Civil Rights history survive within the Old West Baltimore National Register Historic District (including the neighborhoods of Madison Park, Upton, Druid Heights, Harlem Park, and Sandtown-Winchester). Examples include the former St. Peter’s P.E. Church (built 1868) which was purchased by Bethel A.M.E. Church in 1910; Public School No. 103 (built 1877) converted to use as black school the same year; and the Druid Hill Avenue Branch of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) built in 1919. In 1928, the Coppin Normal School, Colored Junior High School, and offices for the Baltimore colored school administration moved into the former Western High School building on McCulloh Street.

Black occupancy and activism was not solely limited to West Baltimore, however, as seen in the Morgan Park neighborhood near Morgan State University where development began in 1917. African American communities in Baltimore County included St. Stephens A.M.E. Church (which built a new church in 1907 to replace a 1878 structure; the church was replaced again in 1972); Big Falls where an African American schoolhouse on Hereford Road remained in use until 1936; Cuba Road which grew around Gough United Methodist Church (erected in 1907 to replace an 1875 church and school building); Lutherville where Colored School Number 24 opened in 1909 (making it the second oldest African American schoolhouse in Baltimore County).[@e.h.t._traceries_african_2016]

<!-- TODO: Decide if it makes sense to note Preston Gardens (built 1917) as a significant site in this period. -->

While the efforts of Baltimore's Civil Rights activists in the late nineteenth century successfully defended some of the rights African Americans won following the Civil War, legal setbacks such as the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and Berea College v. Kentucky (1908) encouraged new white supremacist campaigns to segregate public accommodations, attack the rights of black voters, and restrict black students to underfunded public schools. One national example of these movement is the "Mississippi Plan" of 1890 which "helped to instigate a new racial policy in the South by providing a model by which southern states could disenfranchise blacks." Historian Bruce Thompson noted:

>Between 1890 and 1910, every state below the Border South (Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri) found ways to disenfranchise their black populations.[@thompson_civil_1996, 1]

Securing political support for any challenge as, by 1910, even the Republican Party openly segregating black party members at local meetings and conferences.[@thompson_civil_1996, 32] Black voters, which included black women after the approval of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, made up a small portion of the city's voters. Thompson notes:

>In 1900, blacks comprised fifteen percent of the voting-age population and fifteen percent of the registered voters. By 1932, blacks comprised sixteen percent of the voting-age population, but only twelve percent of the registered voters. Only in a few wards did the black vote make a difference in local elections. In 1931, four wards had a black majority and three others were evenly populated by blacks and whites.[@thompson_civil_1996, 33]

In the absence of leadership from elected officials, Civil Rights activists in Baltimore, and across the United States, continued to fight and, in some cases, win in the courts. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Guinn v. United States (1915) outlawed grandfather clauses; Buchanan v. Warley (1917) abolished residential segregation ordinances (which had gained popularity in a number of city's after Baltimore passed the first one in 1910); Moore v. Dempsey (1923) outlawed mob trials; and Nixon v. Herndon (1927) abolished the practice of white primaries. Bruce Thompson has argued that these cases were distinct from the earlier advocacy of suggesting the efforts of the Brotherhood of Liberty in the 1880s and 1890s used the law to "defend black civil rights against encroachments by whites" but not "strengthen, re-establish, or expand black civil rights".[@thompson_civil_1996, 28] Thompson writes:

>These were important victories for the civil rights struggle because they showed that blacks could respond to segregation and the abridgement of rights and helped set the stage for the civil rights movement.[@thompson_civil_1996, 3]

In Baltimore, African American residents succeeded in their efforts between 1904 and 1918 to limit the growth of legal segregation in transportation, voting rights, and housing.[@thompson_civil_1996, 31]

In recognition of the notable challenges in this period, some scholars have diminished the significance of activism in Baltimore during the early 20th century and instead portrayed a later period beginning between the 1930s and 1950s as a kind of “golden age” of civil rights activism in the city.^[For example, Bruce Thompson wrote "Before 1935, blacks and the civil rights struggle were on the defensive, responding to segregation and the loss of rights." (p.4). Thompson also suggests that for the City-Wide Young People's Forum: "Race consciousness emerged as a major theme in the spring of 1932 after the lynching of a black man on Maryland’s Eastern Shore in December 1931." (p. 52).] Historian Dennis Doster has argued for the importance of an expansive that includes "struggles for access to municipal and social services and struggles related to labor and employment." Using this definition, Doster notes the importance of less well-known organizations including the Federation of Parent-Teacher Clubs, the Women’s Cooperative Civic League, the Independent Republican League, and the Baltimore Urban League.[@doster_strike_2015] Other significant groups in this early period included fraternal organizations such as the Monumental Lodge No. 3;[@schiszik_monumental_2013] and philanthropic groups such as the CYWCA (founded in 1896) and the Colored Fresh Air and Empty Stocking Circle (established in 1904 by Ida Cummings and other members of the CYWCA).[@bowling_how_2002]

Notable individual activists and leaders during this period included City Councilman Harry S. Cummings (1866–1917); lawyers Everett J. Waring (1859–1914), Warner T. McGuinn (1859–1937), and George W. F. McMechen (1871–1961); and newspaper editor Dr. Carl J. Murphy (1889–1967). Significant organizations included the NAACP (established in 1909, with a Baltimore chapter beginning in 1912) and the Baltimore Urban League (established nationally in 1910, with a Baltimore chapter beginning in 1924). The _Afro-American Newspaper_ under the editorial leadership of Carl Murphy (beginning with the death of John Murphy, Sr. in 1922) also became a vocal proponent of Civil Rights in Baltimore, exemplified by efforts such as the newspaper's campaign against segregated buses and discrimination by bus drivers along Howard Street in July 1929.[@farrar_baltimore_1998]

These varied organizations and individual activists and leaders subscribed to a range of different beliefs about how black Baltimoreans could successfully counter white supremacist attacks on their lives and communities. Historian Bruce Thompson contrasts the philosophies of Booker T. Washington and the accommodationist "Atlanta Compromise" with the "more radical" position of  W.E.B. DuBois, writing:

>For W. E. B. Du Bois, accommodation and uplift would not solve the problems blacks faced. He advocated the more radical position that blacks should oppose segregation and work for their political and civil rights.[@thompson_civil_1996, 2]

These national debates influenced, and were influenced by, local Civil Rights activism in Baltimore as local events took place in a national context and activists worked as part of a national movement. In 1905, Rev. Harvey Johnson and four other members of Baltimore's Brotherhood of Liberty were among the twenty-nine people from fourteen states who met near Buffalo, New York to form the Niagra Movement. Historian Bettye Collier-Thomas suggested that W.E.B. DuBois was in “close contact with members of the Brotherhood... as he frequently traveled there to deliver speeches” between 1895 and 1910. Collier-Thomas noted that the Brotherhood “willingly shared twenty years of experience, strategy development and know-how with the founders at Niagara.”[@collier-thomas_harvey_1991, 224]^[The Niagara Movement ended after just a few years but led directly to the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909.] The city also included many supporters of Booker T. Washington, however, as the [National Negro Business League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Negro_Business_League) (organized by in Boston in 1900) held their Ninth Annual Convention in Baltimore in 1908. For others, the Niagra Movement and, later, the NAACP were not radical enough. Pastor and educator Rev. James Robert Lincoln Diggs	(1866-1922) at Trinity Baptist Church was a prominent supporter of the [Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Negro_Improvement_Association_and_African_Communities_League) (UNIA-ACL) (established in 1914). In 1918, the new local chapter of  UNIA organized an event at Bethel AME Church featuring Marcus Garvey and Ida B. Wells-Barnett:

>Rev. William Sampson Brooks cosponsored an event at Bethel with the Baltimore division of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, led by William D. Rankin, on December 18, 1918 featuring Marcus Garvey and Ida B. Wells-Barnett as speakers.[@mamiya_social_1994, 250-251]

There are several important themes to the changes that took place within the movement in this period including:

- black opposition to white supremacist efforts to impose housing segregation on black households and disenfranchise black voters.
- the local and national movement to stop lynchings, mob violence, and criminal injustice
- grass-roots activism to improve housing conditions and educational opportunities for African Americans in Baltimore
- the expansion of voting rights for women (including African American women) and the emerging role of black women as organizers and activists

## Opposition to segregation and disenfranchisement

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, many prominent white political leaders, especially within the Democratic Party, championed white supremacist policies of disenfranchising black voters and segregating housing and public accomodations. Some contemporaries argued that segregation was a "solution" to the disturbing violence of lynchings. Recent historians (notably Grace Elizabeth Hale) have illustrated how segregation was a key part of how, after the Civil War and the end of Reconstruction, white Americans reasserted their dominance in the South through a cultural system based on violence and physical separation.[@hale_making_2010] Historian Carl Nightingale, echoes this analysis writing:

>Jim Crow ordinances segregating rail and trolley cars, theaters, restaurants and other public amenities signaled Southern whites' final rejection of physical proximity as a method of social control, and their embrace of distance.[@nightingale_transnational_2006, 674]

In Maryland, the state legislature passed a law in 1904 to require segregation on all railroads and, in 1908, extended the law to include electric lines and steamboats. Black opponents in Baltimore secured "an exemption /[from the law] for travel within Baltimore, but outside the city limits all blacks suffered the ignominy of being separated."[@thompson_civil_1996, 31] Baltimore lawyer  W. Ashbie Hawkins argued a test case against the racist transportation ordinance in 1920 but the law was upheld and remained on the books up until 1951.[@thompson_civil_1996, 32]

The effect of this limited success was later recalled by Thurgood Marshall who grew up in Baltimore in the 1910s and 1920s,  "The only thing different between the South and Baltimore was trolley cars. They weren't segregated. Everything else was segregated."[@thompson_civil_1996, 12] (Thompson cites Juan Williams, "Marshall's Law," Washington Post Magazine, 7 January 1990, 12-17.)

The state legislature also promoted the disenfranchisement of black voters in a series of proposals between 1905 and 1910. A coalition of African American activists and recent European immigrants worked together under the banner of the Maryland Suffrage League to defeat all three. Republican party leaders like prominent Baltimore lawyer Charles J. Bonaparte also played an role in rallying opposition to these proposals, as historian Jane L. Phelps described Bonaparte's opposition to the Poe and Strauss Amendments in 1905 and 1908.[@phelps_charles_1959] Ultimately opponents to the disenfranchisement campaign succeeded, defeating the Poe Amendment in a vote of 104,286 to 70,227 in 1905. In 1908, voters defeated the similar Strauss disenfranchisement bill more narrowly 106,069 to 98,808. Maryland voters defeated a third attempt, the Digges Amendment, more clearly in 1910: about 84,000 to 46,000.[@smith_here_2008, 65]

Baltimore's 1910 housing segregation bill has been well-studied by historians including Garrett Power[@power_apartheid_1983] and, more Carl Nightingale[@nightingale_transnational_2006], Sam Roberts[@jr_infectious_2009], Gretchen Boger[@boger_meaning_2009], and Dennis Halpin.[@halpin_reforming_2012]

Dennis Halpin notes:

>By the end of the 1910s, black Baltimoreans resistance to the ordinances remade the city’s racial geography. Nevertheless, they struggled to challenge the strategies segregationists used in the wake of the laws’ demise.[@halpin_reforming_2012, 204]

Segregationists quickly shifted to promote exclusion through other means, e.g. "protective" associations and formal and informal racial covenants.

Doster also ties the national advocacy of the NAACP around residential segregation had roots in the fight over segregation in Baltimore.[@doster_strike_2015]

Thompson (citing Garrett Power (p. 298-303)) described how the 1910 housing segregation ordinance worked, writing:

>This ordinance prohibited blacks from purchasing or occupying houses on blocks in which fifty-one percent of the dwellers were white. Similarly, whites could not move into blocks that were predominantly black. The City Council passed the measure, and Mayor J. Barry Mahool signed it into law in December 1910. In less than one month, twenty-six cases were on the court docket. In the very first case, the presiding judges ruled that
the law was invalid because it was drawn incorrectly. [@thompson_civil_1996, 34-35]

Bruce Thompson describes how, after the 1910 residential segregation ordinance was overturned on a technicality in 1911:

>The City Council passed the second segregation ordinance, repealed it one month later on technical grounds, and then repassed it with amendments. This third segregation ordinance was signed into law on May 15, 1911, as Mahool's last official act as mayor. ... A suitable challenge to this ordinance took two years to emerge, but in 1913 W. Ashbie Hawkins defended John E. Gurry for moving into an all-white block.[@thompson_civil_1996, 35]

In 1913, efforts continued, as Thompson writes:

>Baltimore's City Council had passed a fourth segregation ordinance one week before the third ordinance was ruled unconstitutional by Maryland's Court of Appeals in 1913. This fourth ordinance overcame the constitutional objections by making the law applicable only to future sales or rentals. People owning property at the time the fourth ordinance was passed could occupy their residences, no matter where they were located. In 1915, Hawkins defended Thomas S. Jackson for violating this latest ordinance. After losing in the lower court, Hawkins was prepared to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.[@thompson_civil_1996, 36]

Thompson continues:

>Three months later black Baltimoreans rejoiced again when the Maryland Court of Appeals overturned Baltimore's fourth segregation ordinance in Jackson v. State. In writing its opinion, the court concluded: "It is thus definitely settled, upon highest authority, that the right of the individual citizen to acquire or use property can not be validly restricted, by State or municipality, on the ground of his color."[@thompson_civil_1996, 37]

**Note:** This section needs to include additional information on:

- 1917, Morgan College move to northeast Baltimore, unsuccessful suit by neighbors to keep it from moving there
- Buchanan v. Warley (1917)


## Mob violence and anti-lynching advocacy

This period saw a surge of white violence against African Americans in Maryland and in cities around the country. One example from Maryland, notable for the proximity to Baltimore, was the lynching of King Johnson in Brooklyn, Maryland on December 26, 1911.[@maryland_state_archives_king_2015]

Beyond individual lynchings, black communities around the country had to contend with the threat of violent anti-black riots by white neighbors (examples in the table below).

|  **Event** | **Dates** | **Description** |
|  --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
|  East St. Louis, Illinois Riot | July 1, 1917 | Riot killed at least 39 black people and 8 white people, injured hundreds, and caused millions of damages. Mass meeting held at AME Church in Baltimore (?) in response |
|  Washington, DC Riot | July 19 - 22 1919 |  |
|  Chicago Riot | July 27 - August 23, 1919 |  |
|  Tulsa Riot | May 31 - June 1, 1921 |  |
|  Elaine, Arkansas Riot | September 30 - October 1, 1923 |  |

<!-- TODO: Add link to [data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AlIif_aqanb1YbYFiZdatb5XpBlvKcdTmLrg3mLR5Wc/edit?usp=sharing) to the text somewhere. -->

These events took place concurrently with the local and national resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan.   On October 10, 1922, the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in Annapolis and organized other rallies in Frederick and Baltimore that same year. In early 1923, the Ku Klux Klan presented a charity circus in Hazazer's Hall (where?) and publicized the Klan’s endorsement of Protestantism. Visits were made to the United Brethren Church (where?) and the Roland Avenue Methodist Church at 40th Street and Roland Avenue. The pastor of the latter church accepted a $25 check from the Klan, remarking, "I, for one, am glad to get it.” In March 1923, a Klan meeting at the Brooklyn First Baptist Church at 3801 5th Street was "almost broken up by an angry mob."[@jackson_ku_1967, 181]

The threat of violence was not limited to illegal lynchings but included the violence of Baltimore police officers. Noted incidents of police violence include the beating of a black soldier (criticized in February 1918 by Judge Robert F. Stanton who later served as Police Commissioner from 1938 to 1943);  a 1918 shooting of a black man on Pennsylvania Avenue on June 1, 1918; Baltimore police officer James O. Jones in “beating up” Henry Boyer in 1926, the clubbing of Henry Simuels in 1927.^[See the study on [Criminal Injustice](/civil-rights-heritage/criminal-injustice/) for additional information.] As a student at the the Colored High School on Pennsylvania Avenue in the early 1920s, Thurgood Marshall had a close-up view of the Northwestern District Police Station and their treatment of black suspects. In _Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary_, Juan Williams quotes Marshall’s recollection of what he heard, writing:

>“We could hear police in there beating the hell out of people, saying, ‘Black boy, why don’t you just shut your goddamned mouth, you’re going to talk yourself into the electric chair.’”[@williams_thurgood_2011, 40]

In 1925, the Conference of AME Ministers sets up a committee to consider the best way to place black officers on the police force.[@farrar_baltimore_1998, 112] In a 1926 report on capital punishment in Maryland the _Afro-American_ newspaper called for an end to the death penalty pointing out that between 1903 and 1926, nine of the ten men executed in Maryland for murder or rape were black.[@farrar_baltimore_1998, 115-117]

## Improving conditions for African Americans

In many northern cities, public debates around poverty and difficult living conditions were influenced by the Great Migration. The National Urban League was established in New York City as the Committee on Urban Conditions Among Negroes, on September 29, 1910, and focused on the needs of new migrants to the city. Although the proportion of migrants to Baltimore was much smaller, conditions for many were still difficult. Historian Samuel Kelton Roberts noted the challenges for black students attending the city's segregated schools, writing:

>Baltimore’s black public schools were crowded and in disrepair, housed in the cast-off buildings left behind as whites moved to better facilities. ... Despite the reorganization of the city government and the educational system, no new black schools were built between 1898 and 1915.[@roberts_infectious_2002, 28]

a local chapter of the Urban League was established in 1924.

Anti-poverty efforts in Baltimore's black community had a long history. One example of an early effort was the Women's Cooperative Civic League:

>The Women's Cooperative Civic League, an all-black female group, was formed in 1913 at the request of a group of white citizens to address housing, health, sanitation, and educational problems resulting from the rapid urban growth. Under the leadership of Sara Fernandis the city was organized into wards headed by community activists. By 1914, the membership had grown to 130.[@gordon_african_1997, 124]

In 1927, the Maryland state legislature established the “Interracial Commission” (Chapter 559, Acts of 1927) to create a framework for discussing Civil Rights policy issues.

## New rights for women

One of the most significant changes in this period was the expansion of voting rights for women through the Nineteenth Amendment which was ratified on August	26, 1920.

The modern history of the organized suffrage movement in Maryland began in 1909 when Edith Houghton Hooker founded the Just Government League of Maryland.

In 1919, Maryland's Senators split over the issue of women's suffrage with Democrat John Walter Smith voting against the amendment and Republican Senator Joseph I. France voting for it. When the measure came before the Maryland legislature on February 24, 1920, they rejected the amendment; in part due to concerns over the expansion of suffrage to black women at a time when many white Marylanders still wanted to see more restrictions on voting rights for African Americans.

On November 2, 1920, women voted for first time in Maryland and, in 1921, the Women's Suffrage League of Maryland affiliated with the recently formed League of Women Voters of the United States. Finally, on November 7, 1922, a state (?) Constitutional amendment (Chapter 275, Acts of 1922) was ratified making women eligible to hold public office.

In 1920, the Colored Women's YWCA became an official chapter of the Baltimore YWCA.

>Carrie Chapman Catt's League of Women Voters and the Alice Paul-led Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (late known as the National Woman's Party) both acted in coalition with southern white political leaders and their ideology of white supremacy.

Felicia L. Jamison attributes the rise of female leadership within Sharp Street United Methodist Church to work that women put towards "defraying the newly acquired $70,000 debt for the new edifice" erected in 1898. The women Jamison profiles were active participants in the broader Women‘s Club Movement and Progressive Movement. In 1919, under the leadership of Rev. M. J. Naylor, Sharp Street Church established a community program that "included a kindergarten, a day nursery, and an employment bureau."[@jamison_leading_2010, 41] These efforts culminated in the construction of the Sharp Street Community House "a church-affiliated community center that housed young and poverty stricken women, and offered professional classes to the Baltimore black community."[@jamison_leading_2010, 5] Jamison quotes the Community House Annual Report for 1921-1922, which describes how the Community House sought:

>[to] provide a higher civic and social life, to institute and maintain educational and philanthropic enterprises and to investigate and improve conditions generally through co-operation with other social agencies.[@jamison_leading_2010, 6]

Another example is the N.M. Carroll Chapter of Sharp Street Church's Epworth League. In 1910, the N.M. Carroll chapter opened a coffee shop and soup house in the Windsor Flats section of Baltimore.[@jamison_leading_2010, 83] A similar mission drove the organization of the Colored Empty Stocking and Fresh Air Circle, a society that was established after the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904 to help Baltimore‘s dependent children.[@neverdon-morton_self-help_1982, 219] (Double-check the page number for this reference.) Historian Cynthia Neverdon-Morton argues that the significance of this effort is seen, in part, by the interdenominational character of their work where church women throughout the city, "regardless of class or level of education, worked together in a number of social and charitable organizations to better their community."[@jamison_leading_2010, 80] (Note: We're quoting Jamison referencing Neverdon-Morton – need to go back and review the original.)

Jamison concludes:

>Like many turn-of-the-century African-American women across the nation, the women of Sharp Street Church noticed the many needs in their community and sought to fulfill them. ...  After witnessing the lack of proper healthcare and the substandard living conditions of African Americans in Baltimore, the women organized church events to meet the economic as well as social needs of their community.[@jamison_leading_2010, 85]

### Schools and Education

Notes from "The Strayer survey and the colored schools of Baltimore City, 1923–1943" by Angela D. Johnson:

>In 1900, there were eighteen schools designated for African American children, and many of them had been constructed before the Civil War.25 For example, School no. 116 at Druid Hill Avenue near Biddle Street was erected in 1842; School no. 109 at Fremont and King Streets was constructed in 1843; and School no. 101 at Jefferson Street near Caroline Street was built in 1855.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 15]

>In addition, several schools in Baltimore City that were set aside for African Americans were erected after the Civil War; they were School no. 105 at Roger Avenue near Lexington Street in 1874, School no. 106 at Hill and Sharp Streets in 1893, and School no. 101 located at Mount and Saratoga Streets in 1896.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 15]

>James H. N. Waring, principal of the Colored High and Manual Training School[@johnson_strayer_2012, 16]

>At the state level, for example, the Maryland State Teachers Association campaigned in 1915 for an extended school term for colored schools.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 18]

>Even though the school reform efforts were slow, the segregated schools of Baltimore City did benefit from the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 with the expansion of home economics and vocational classes.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 19]

>Indeed, the editors of the Baltimore Afro-American Newspaper demanded Charles Koch, the superintendent of schools, to hire an African American superintendent. Hayward Farrar cites Koch‘s response: ― ̳Blacks were not far enough developed to have a school board member, but would do well as members of the street cleaning force."[@johnson_strayer_2012, 20]

>The problems of the Baltimore School System were not hidden: overcrowded schools, inadequate facilities, poor school curriculum, and out dated management practices.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 23]

>The survey recommended that all trade and apprentice programs be opened up to African Americans, especially since 1910 they were in almost all of the various occupations in the city.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 34]

After the Strayer Survey published the Baltimore City School board did not promise any immediate action:

>This potential inaction was a blow to the African American community, which was not only supportive of the school survey, but also excited about its recommendations. African Americans, who had been excluded from housing, social, and school reform efforts throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, believed that the Strayer report would provide a real opportunity for the segregated schools to participate in much needed school reform[@johnson_strayer_2012, 36]

Dr. Francis Russell as the Director of the Baltimore City Division of Colored Schools[@johnson_strayer_2012, 37]

In 1925, Francis M. Woods becomes supervisor and later director of the Baltimore Colored Schools:

>On August 1, 1925, Francis Marion Wood was appointed supervisor of all African American schools of Baltimore City; he would stay in the position until 1943, overseeing many changes. With a starting salary of $4200 per school year, Wood relocated to Baltimore with his wife Nellie and their four children. Wood‘s position included the responsibility for implementing and overseeing the recommendations of the Strayer Report. Supervisor Wood reported to David Weglein, who was Superintendent of Public Instructions and who reported to the nine members of the Board of School Commissioners, the Mayor, and the Baltimore City Council.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 40]
