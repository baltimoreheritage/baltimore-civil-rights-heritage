## Introduction

Baltimore’s urban landscape experienced major changes during the first three decades of the twentieth century. Following the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904, the city rebuilt the downtown area and, in 1915, the city dedicated a new sanitary sewer system after decades of delay. In 1918, Baltimore City annexed a large area of Baltimore County spurring a rapid expansion of neighborhoods along the corridor of the city's electric streetcar system. For black Baltimoreans some things remained the same: continued discrimination against black workers, and woefully unequal conditions for black students and teachers in the city's public schools. And not all changes offered good news: black Baltimoreans fought against an aggressive effort to impose racial segregation on residential neighborhoods and struggled to get their fair share of benefits from the city's growth.

Overall, the city's population grew from around 509,000 in 1900 to 733,826 in 1920, reaching 804,874 people by 1930. The city's black population grew from 79,739 in 1900; 84,749 in 1910; 108,322 in 1920; and 142,106 in 1930.^[U.S. Census, 1900; 1910; 1920; 1930.] In the antebellum period, most of the new black migrants to Baltimore came from Maryland or Virginia — a pattern that continued into the early twentieth century. In 1910, 87% of the black population in Baltimore was native to Maryland. Of the 13% born outside of the state, migrants from Virginia made up 8.7% of the total. This pattern set Baltimore apart from other large cities with a growing black population in this period. In 1920, 76% of Baltimore's black population was native to Maryland, in comparison to Detroit's 8.4% or Manhattan's 20.9%. By 1930, the proportion of native Marylanders diminished so 59.4% of Baltimore's black residents (142,106 people) were born in the state (a modest decline of 17.1% since 1910).[@reich_baltimore_2014, 18]

<!-- TODO: Write about economic challenges during this period, e.g. Panic of 1901, Panic of 1903, economic downturn following WWI, and the start of the Great Depression -->

<!-- TODO: Add more information about the annexation and how it affected the city. Find 1920 and 1930 data for black population growth. -->

The growth of racially segregated suburbs at the edges of the city, formal and informal policies of clearance and containment to promote the isolation of black neighborhoods, and the segregated condition of Baltimore's public schools all contributed to the increasing concentration of Baltimore's black population in northwest Baltimore. At present, many buildings with important associations to this period of Civil Rights history survive within the Old West Baltimore National Register Historic District (including the neighborhoods of Madison Park, Upton, Druid Heights, Harlem Park, and Sandtown-Winchester). Examples include the former St. Peter’s P.E. Church (built 1868) which was purchased by Bethel A.M.E. Church in 1910; Public School No. 103 (built 1877) converted to use as black school the same year; and the Druid Hill Avenue Branch of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) built in 1919. In 1928, the Coppin Normal School, Colored Junior High School, and offices for the Baltimore colored school administration moved into the former Western High School building on McCulloh Street.

Black occupancy and activism was not solely limited to West Baltimore, however, as seen in the Morgan Park neighborhood near Morgan State University where development began around 1917. In Baltimore County, active African American communities in this period included St. Stephens A.M.E. Church (which built a new church in 1907 to replace a 1878 structure; the church was replaced again in 1972); Big Falls where an African American schoolhouse on Hereford Road remained in use until 1936; Cuba Road which grew around Gough United Methodist Church (erected in 1907 to replace an 1875 church and school building); Lutherville where Colored School Number 24 opened in 1909 (making the building the second oldest African American schoolhouse in Baltimore County).[@e.h.t._traceries_african_2016]

<!-- TODO: Decide if it makes sense to note Preston Gardens (built 1917) as a significant site in this period. -->

!["Pay day for the stevedores", c. 1905. Detroit Publishing Company. _[Courtesy Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/resource/det.4a12583/)._](https://cdn.loc.gov/service/pnp/det/4a10000/4a12000/4a12500/4a12583v.jpg)

While the efforts of Baltimore's Civil Rights activists in the late nineteenth century successfully defended some of the rights African Americans won following the Civil War, legal setbacks such as the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and Berea College v. Kentucky (1908) encouraged new white supremacist campaigns to segregate public accommodations, attack the rights of black voters, and restrict black students to underfunded public schools. One national example of these movement is the "Mississippi Plan" of 1890 which "helped to instigate a new racial policy in the South by providing a model by which southern states could disenfranchise blacks." Historian Bruce Thompson noted:

>Between 1890 and 1910, every state below the Border South (Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri) found ways to disenfranchise their black populations.[@thompson_civil_1996, 1]

Securing political support for any challenge as, by 1910, even the Republican Party openly segregating black party members at local meetings and conferences.[@thompson_civil_1996, 32] African American voters, a group that included black women after the approval (WC?) of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, made up a small share of the city's voters. Thompson notes:

>In 1900, blacks comprised fifteen percent of the voting-age population and fifteen percent of the registered voters. By 1932, blacks comprised sixteen percent of the voting-age population, but only twelve percent of the registered voters. Only in a few wards did the black vote make a difference in local elections. In 1931, four wards had a black majority and three others were evenly populated by blacks and whites.[@thompson_civil_1996, 33]

In the absence of leadership from elected officials, Civil Rights activists in Baltimore, and across the United States, continued to fight and, in some cases, win in the courts. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Guinn v. United States (1915) outlawed grandfather clauses; Buchanan v. Warley (1917) abolished residential segregation ordinances (which had gained popularity in many cities after Baltimore passed the first such law in 1910); Moore v. Dempsey (1923) outlawed mob trials; and Nixon v. Herndon (1927) abolished the practice of white primaries. Bruce Thompson has argued that these cases were distinct from the earlier advocacy of suggesting the efforts of the Brotherhood of Liberty in the 1880s and 1890s used the law to "defend black civil rights against encroachments by whites" but not "strengthen, re-establish, or expand black civil rights".[@thompson_civil_1996, 28] Thompson writes:

>These were important victories for the civil rights struggle because they showed that blacks could respond to segregation and the abridgement of rights and helped set the stage for the civil rights movement.[@thompson_civil_1996, 3]

In Baltimore, African American residents succeeded in some efforts between 1904 and 1918 to limit the growth of legal segregation in transportation, voting rights, and housing.[@thompson_civil_1996, 31] However, as the city's black population grew in the 1920s, conditions for black workers and residents remained difficult. In 1927, the Maryland state legislature established the “Interracial Commission” (Chapter 559, Acts of 1927) to create a framework for discussing Civil Rights policy issues. The activism of this period set the stage for the more radical changes that took place in Baltimore between the 1930s and 1950s.

In recognition of the notable challenges in this period, some scholars have diminished the significance of activism in Baltimore during the early twentieth century and instead portrayed a later period beginning between the 1930s and 1950s as a kind of “golden age” of civil rights activism in the city.^[For example, Bruce Thompson wrote "Before 1935, blacks and the civil rights struggle were on the defensive, responding to segregation and the loss of rights." (p.4). Thompson also suggests that for the City-Wide Young People's Forum: "Race consciousness emerged as a major theme in the spring of 1932 after the lynching of a black man on Maryland’s Eastern Shore in December 1931." (p. 52).] Historian Dennis Doster has argued for the importance of an expansive that includes "struggles for access to municipal and social services and struggles related to labor and employment." Using this definition, Doster notes the importance of less well-known organizations including the Federation of Parent-Teacher Clubs, the Women’s Cooperative Civic League, the Independent Republican League, and the Baltimore Urban League.[@doster_strike_2015] Other significant groups in this early period included fraternal organizations such as the Monumental Lodge No. 3;[@schiszik_monumental_2013] and philanthropic groups such as the CYWCA (founded in 1896) and the Colored Fresh Air and Empty Stocking Circle (established in 1904 by Ida Cummings and other members of the CYWCA).[@bowling_how_2002]

Prominent individual activists and leaders during this period included City Councilman Harry S. Cummings (1866–1917); lawyers Everett J. Waring (1859–1914), Warner T. McGuinn (1859–1937), and George W. F. McMechen (1871–1961); and newspaper editor Dr. Carl J. Murphy (1889–1967). Significant organizations included the NAACP (established in 1909, with a Baltimore chapter beginning in 1912) and the Baltimore Urban League (established nationally in 1910, with a Baltimore chapter beginning in 1924). The _Afro-American Newspaper_ under the editorial leadership of Carl Murphy (beginning with the death of John Murphy, Sr. in 1922) also became a vocal proponent of Civil Rights in Baltimore, exemplified by efforts such as the newspaper's campaign against segregated buses and discrimination by bus drivers along Howard Street in July 1929.[@farrar_baltimore_1998]

These varied organizations and individual activists and leaders subscribed to a range of different beliefs about how black Baltimoreans could successfully counter white supremacist attacks on their lives and communities. Historian Bruce Thompson contrasts the philosophies of Booker T. Washington and the accommodationist "Atlanta Compromise" with the "more radical" position of W.E.B. DuBois, writing:

>For W. E. B. Du Bois, accommodation and uplift would not solve the problems blacks faced. He advocated the more radical position that blacks should oppose segregation and work for their political and civil rights.[@thompson_civil_1996, 2]

These national debates influenced, and were influenced by, local Civil Rights activism in Baltimore as local events took place in a national context and activists worked as part of a national movement. In 1905, Rev. Harvey Johnson and four other members of Baltimore's Brotherhood of Liberty were among the twenty-nine people from fourteen states who met near Buffalo, New York to form the Niagra Movement. Historian Bettye Collier-Thomas suggested that W.E.B. DuBois was in “close contact with members of the Brotherhood... as he frequently traveled there to deliver speeches” between 1895 and 1910. Collier-Thomas noted that the Brotherhood “willingly shared twenty years of experience, strategy development and know-how with the founders at Niagara.”[@collier-thomas_harvey_1991, 224]^[The Niagara Movement ended after just a few years but led directly to the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909.] The city also included many supporters of Booker T. Washington, however, as the [National Negro Business League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Negro_Business_League) (organized by in Boston in 1900) held their Ninth Annual Convention in Baltimore in 1908. For others, the Niagra Movement and, later, the NAACP were not radical enough. Pastor and educator Rev. James Robert Lincoln Diggs	(1866-1922) at Trinity Baptist Church was a prominent supporter of the [Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Negro_Improvement_Association_and_African_Communities_League) (UNIA-ACL) (established in 1914).

This section of the study is organized around four important themes:

- black opposition to white supremacist efforts to disenfranchise black voters and promote racial segregation in housing and public accommodations.
- the local and national movement to stop lynchings, mob violence, and criminal injustice
- grass-roots activism to improve housing conditions and educational opportunities for African Americans in Baltimore
- the expansion of voting rights for women (including African American women) and the emerging role of black women as organizers and activists

## Opposition to disenfranchisement and segregation

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, prominent white political leaders, especially within the Democratic Party, championed white supremacist policies of disenfranchising black voters and segregating housing and public accommodations. Some contemporaries argued that segregation was a "solution" to the disturbing violence of lynchings. Recent historians (notably Grace Elizabeth Hale) have illustrated how segregation was a key part of how, after the Civil War and the end of Reconstruction, white Americans reasserted their dominance in the South through a cultural system based on violence and physical separation.[@hale_making_2010] Historian Carl Nightingale, echoes this analysis writing:

>Jim Crow ordinances segregating rail and trolley cars, theaters, restaurants and other public amenities signaled Southern whites' final rejection of physical proximity as a method of social control, and their embrace of distance.[@nightingale_transnational_2006, 674]

In Maryland, the state legislature passed a law in 1904 to require segregation on all railroads and, in 1908, extended the law to include electric lines and steamboats. Black opponents in Baltimore secured "an exemption [from the law] for travel within Baltimore, but outside the city limits all blacks suffered the ignominy of being separated."[@thompson_civil_1996, 31] Baltimore lawyer W. Ashbie Hawkins argued a test case against the racist transportation ordinance in 1920 but the law was upheld and remained on the books up until 1951.[@thompson_civil_1996, 32]

The segregated character of city life during this period was later recalled by Thurgood Marshall who grew up in Baltimore in the 1910s and 1920s, "The only thing different between the South and Baltimore was trolley cars. They weren't segregated. Everything else was segregated."^[See @thompson_civil_1996, 12; Thompson cites Juan Williams, "Marshall's Law," Washington Post Magazine, 7 January 1990, 12-17.]

The state legislature also promoted the disenfranchisement of black voters in a series of proposals between 1905 and 1910. A coalition of African American activists and recent European immigrants worked together under the banner of the Maryland Suffrage League to defeat all three. Republican party leaders like prominent Baltimore lawyer Charles J. Bonaparte also played an role in rallying opposition to these proposals, as historian Jane L. Phelps described Bonaparte's opposition to the Poe and Strauss Amendments in 1905 and 1908.[@phelps_charles_1959] Ultimately opponents to the disenfranchisement campaign succeeded, defeating the Poe Amendment in a vote of 104,286 to 70,227 in 1905. In 1908, voters defeated the similar Strauss disenfranchisement bill more narrowly 106,069 to 98,808. Maryland voters defeated a third attempt, the Digges Amendment, in 1910 about 84,000 to 46,000 votes.[@smith_here_2008, 65]

Not long after on December 19, 1910, Baltimore City passed a new law, known commonly as the West Ordinance after the bill's proponent Councilman Samuel T. West, to require the racial segregation of residential blocks in Baltimore. Historian Bruce Thompson described how the 1910 housing segregation ordinance was intended to work, writing:

>This ordinance prohibited blacks from purchasing or occupying houses on blocks in which fifty-one percent of the dwellers were white. Similarly, whites could not move into blocks that were predominantly black.

However, Thompson continues to note:

>In less than one month, twenty-six cases were on the court docket. In the very first case, the presiding judges ruled that the law was invalid because it was drawn incorrectly.[@thompson_civil_1996, 34-35; @power_apartheid_198, 298-303]

After the first ordinance was overturned, the City Council passed a similar ordinance on April 7, 1911 which they quickly repealed and replaced with a third segregation ordinance on May 15, 1911. The third ordinance was entitled:

> an ordinance for preserving peace, preventing conflict and ill feeling between the white and colored races in Baltimore city, and promoting the general welfare of the city by providing, so far as practicable, for the use of separate blocks by white and colored people for residences, churches and schools.[@_baltimore_1911]

As the first residential segregation law in the country the been the subject of detailed scholarly study over the past thirty years.^[@power_apartheid_198; @nightingale_transnational_2006; @jr_infectious_2009; @boger_meaning_2009; @halpin_reforming_2012; @halpin_struggle_2015]

Dennis Halpin notes:

>By the end of the 1910s, black Baltimoreans resistance to the ordinances remade the city’s racial geography. Nevertheless, they struggled to challenge the strategies segregationists used in the wake of the laws’ demise.[@halpin_reforming_2012, 204]

Segregationists quickly shifted to promote exclusion through other means, e.g. "protective" associations and formal and informal racial covenants.

Doster also ties the national advocacy of the NAACP around residential segregation had roots in the fight over segregation in Baltimore.[@doster_strike_2015]

Bruce Thompson describes how, after the 1910 residential segregation ordinance was overturned on a technicality in 1911:

>The City Council passed the second segregation ordinance, repealed it one month later on technical grounds, and then repassed it with amendments. This third segregation ordinance was signed into law on May 15, 1911, as Mahool's last official act as mayor. ... A suitable challenge to this ordinance took two years to emerge, but in 1913 W. Ashbie Hawkins defended John E. Gurry for moving into an all-white block.[@thompson_civil_1996, 35]

In 1913, efforts continued, as Thompson writes:

>Baltimore's City Council had passed a fourth segregation ordinance one week before the third ordinance was ruled unconstitutional by Maryland's Court of Appeals in 1913. This fourth ordinance overcame the constitutional objections by making the law applicable only to future sales or rentals. People owning property at the time the fourth ordinance was passed could occupy their residences, no matter where they were located. In 1915, Hawkins defended Thomas S. Jackson for violating this latest ordinance. After losing in the lower court, Hawkins was prepared to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.[@thompson_civil_1996, 36]

Thompson continues:

>Three months later black Baltimoreans rejoiced again when the Maryland Court of Appeals overturned Baltimore's fourth segregation ordinance in Jackson v. State. In writing its opinion, the court concluded: "It is thus definitely settled, upon highest authority, that the right of the individual citizen to acquire or use property can not be validly restricted, by State or municipality, on the ground of his color."[@thompson_civil_1996, 37]

Suburban growth also contributed to the growth of racial segregation. With the only exceptions in the neighborhoods of Morgan Park and Howard Park in northeast Baltimore, local builders and developers never erected new homes with the intent to sell to black buyers. Roland Park, developed beginning in 1891, Guilford (developed beginning in 1913) and Homeland (developed beginning in 1924) served as models for developers around the country as the Roland Park Company:

 >...used deed restrictions as the cornerstone of a broader attempt to manufacture a dichotomy between suburban and urban space in order to sell a new spatial and social arrangement to a status-conscious white middle class. Other developers frequently requested copies of its deed restrictions.[@glotzer_exclusion_2015, 481]

Following the decision in Buchanan v. Warley (1917) that declared racial segregation ordinances (including Baltimore's) unconstitutional deed restrictions, racist practices by professional realtors, and urban design and planning (described by some as "clearance and containment") all contributed to the persistence of segregation. Historian Paige Glotzer notes the National Association of Real Estate Boards (NAREB) adoption of a Code of Ethic in 1913 (the same year the Roland Park Company began using racial restrictions in deeds) which was revised in 1924 to prevent any Realtor from:

>“introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy, members of any race or nationality, or any individual whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood.”[@glotzer_exclusion_2015, 488]

The Roland Park Company also planned physical boundaries between their development and nearby properties occupied by black Baltimoreans, for example, planting "a long hedge to cut off sightlines of a predominantly black settlement down the hill, the same settlement where it later located its sewage disposal field."[@glotzer_exclusion_2015, 482-483]

A similar approach was used in the area of Mount Royal Avenue where, in 1909, Colonel C. Baker Clotworthy, commander of the Fifth Regiment, wrote to the _Sun_ advocating for the extension of Howard Street north of the Richmond Market as a way of tearing down homes occupied by African Americans:

> I would be deeply interested in this improvement because it means so much more than simply tearing down some houses and opening a street. Everyone in the city is familiar with the steady decrease which has taken place in the value of property in this neighborhood for the last 20 years.
> All about Richmond Market, and extending north, there are hundreds of undesirable houses and, in many cases, huts. This sore is spreading rapidly. A great many negroes, not of the best class, gradually tenant the houses on the edge of this district and immediately the white people move from the block invaded. If this continues no one knows where it will stop.[@_favors_1909]

While the extension of Howard Street, the construction of the Mount Royal Viaduct, and the erection of the Howard Street Bridge were all delayed until the arrival of Public Works Administration funding in the 1930s, the Mount Royal Protective Association fought for the demolition of homes around the Armory building for the creation of a plaza (around 1930) and boasted of their efforts to secure and enforce racial covenants from local property owners, noting the group's "greatest achievement... has been the subjecting of the property in its area to a restriction for white occupancy only."^[Citation needed!]

Many older neighborhoods could not create the buffers and barriers used in Roland Park but enthusiastically embraced their use of racial covenenants. In January 1924, two hundred members of six West Baltimore protective associations met at the Fulton Avenue Presbyterian Church (at Fulton and Monroe Streets) to fight the movement of African American households into these western neighborhoods. Dr. C.P. Woodward, the City Councilman for the 5th district, is quoted in the _Baltimore Sun_ stating:

> The principal function of any organization is to acquire everything of benefit to the community and to keep away everything undesirable. It is a pity that law-abiding citizens who do not receive sufficient protection from the law to keep out undesirables must form protective associations to do so.[@_plan_1924]

The result of the meeting was a campaign to get 1600 property owners in an area bounded by North Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue and Bentalou Street to sign commitments not to sell to African Americans. The _Baltimore Afro-American_, also reported on the meeting and summarized the sentiment of the speakers as, "Negroes should be put in a bag and pitched overboard."[@_segregationists_1924]

When proponents of segregation took legal action to promote segregation, their efforts were less successful. For example, in 1918, a group of white residents in Lauraville attempted to have the 1917 sale of the Ivy Mill property, where Morgan State University (what was it called at the time?) revoked by the circuit court in Towson. The case was dismissed and, when the Lauraville residents, appealed to the state court who upheld the lower court's decision.^[Diggs v. Morgan College, 105 A. 157, 133 Md. 264 (1918); For more on the history of Morgan State University see @wilson_history_1975 or @dula_prospering_2016; For more on the history of Morgan Park see @mcconnell_history_2000.]

## Movement to stop lynchings, mob violence, and criminal injustice

Segregation and disenfranchisement were not the only consequence of the broad political support for white supremacy in the early twentieth century. While the number of lynchings peaked nationally in the 1890s, lynching remained a major concern  for African American Civil Rights advocates in Baltimore through the 1940s.^[Explore the history of lynching in America in southern states through the [American Lynching website](http://www.americanlynchingdata.com/). See also the Equal Justice Institute's report ["Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror"](http://eji.org/reports/lynching-in-america)]  In 1918, the new local chapter of UNIA organized an event at Bethel AME Church featuring Marcus Garvey and famed anti-lynching advocate Ida B. Wells-Barnett:

>Rev. William Sampson Brooks cosponsored an event at Bethel with the Baltimore division of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, led by William D. Rankin, on December 18, 1918 featuring Marcus Garvey and Ida B. Wells-Barnett as speakers.[@mamiya_social_1994, 250-251]

Other forms of mob violence, such as the wave of riots that affected many American cities during the summer of 1919, also prompted local activists to respond. Following a riot in East St. Louis, Illinois in July 1917 prompted a mass meeting at Bethel AME Church that sent a delegation (including Dr. Carl J. Murphy) to meet with President Woodrow Wilson and urge him to investigate the riot and take action to address the issue.[@farrar_baltimore_1998, 125]

These events took place concurrently with the local and national resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan. For example, on October 10, 1922, the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in Annapolis and organized other rallies in Frederick and Baltimore that same year.^[See [Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan, 1915-1940](https://labs.library.vcu.edu/klan/) for more details on the growth of Klan chapters across the country.] In early 1923, the Ku Klux Klan presented a charity circus in Hazazer's Hall at 111 W. Franklin Street and publicized the Klan’s endorsement of Protestantism. The Klan also visited the United Brethren Church and the Roland Avenue Methodist Church at 40th Street and Roland Avenue. The pastor of the latter church accepted a $25 check from the Klan, remarking, "I, for one, am glad to get it.” In March 1923, a Klan meeting at the Brooklyn First Baptist Church at 3801 5th Street was "almost broken up by an angry mob."[@jackson_ku_1967, 181]

While the majority of lynchings in Maryland took place on the Eastern Shore or in Southern Maryland, black Baltimoreans faced a disproportionate threat of police violence and a broader challenge of criminal injustice. Noted incidents of police violence in this period include the beating of a black soldier (criticized in February 1918 by Judge Robert F. Stanton who later served as Police Commissioner from 1938 to 1943); the shooting of a black man on Pennsylvania Avenue on June 1, 1918; Baltimore police officer James O. Jones in “beating up” Henry Boyer in 1926; and the clubbing of Henry Simuels in 1927.^[@_soldiers_1918; @_penna._1918; @_brutality_1926; @_raise_1927; See the study on [Criminal Injustice](/civil-rights-heritage/criminal-injustice/) for additional information.] As a student at the the Colored High School on Pennsylvania Avenue in the early 1920s, Thurgood Marshall had a close-up view of the Northwestern District Police Station and their treatment of black suspects. In _Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary_, Juan Williams quotes Marshall’s recollection of what he heard, writing:

>“We could hear police in there beating the hell out of people, saying, ‘Black boy, why don’t you just shut your goddamned mouth, you’re going to talk yourself into the electric chair.’”[@williams_thurgood_2011, 40]

Black communities in Baltimore experienced the dual challenges of being both overpoliced and underpoliced as white people who committed crimes against black people could expect much lighter penalties for their actions. For example, in February 1921, five hundred people gathered at Trinity Baptist Church at Druid Hill Avenue and Mosher Street to protest the release of a white man, Harry Feldenheimer, on a $500 bail after he was arrested for an attempted assault on a ten-year-old black girl named Esther Short. The _Afro_ reported that participants in the meeting criticized the "brutality of the local police, exclusion of qualified men from the police force and from juries in the city, and the Jim Crow arrangements for colored people in the Criminal and Juvenile Courts".[@_mass_1921] Disproportionate sentencing is also visible in the a 1926 report from the _Afro-American_ on the unequal use of  capital punishment in Maryland. The newspaper called for an end to the death penalty observing that between 1903 and 1926, nine of the ten men executed in Maryland for murder or rape were black.[@farrar_baltimore_1998, 115-117]

Activists sought to address these problems through stronger oversight of the police and the appointment of black police officers. In 1925, the Conference of AME Ministers set up a committee to consider the best way to place black officers on the police force.[@farrar_baltimore_1998, 112] However, such efforts were largely unsuccessful in this period and it was not until the late 1930s and early 1940s that activists forced the city and state to begin to address their concerns.

## Improving conditions for African Americans

In many northern cities, public debates around poverty and difficult living conditions were influenced by the Great Migration. The National Urban League was established in New York City as the Committee on Urban Conditions Among Negroes, on September 29, 1910, and focused on the needs of new migrants to the city. Although the proportion of migrants to Baltimore was much smaller than New York, conditions for many black Baltimoreans were still difficult. Historian Samuel Kelton Roberts noted the challenges for black students attending the city's segregated schools, writing:

>Baltimore’s black public schools were crowded and in disrepair, housed in the cast-off buildings left behind as whites moved to better facilities. ... Despite the reorganization of the city government and the educational system, no new black schools were built between 1898 and 1915.[@roberts_infectious_2002, 28]

Efforts to address poverty in Baltimore's black community began to expand in the late nineteenth century.^[Note: I'm not sure how to distinguish between moralistic and religious anti-vice campaigns and more genuine efforts to substantively address poverty.] Baltimore's Colored Young Men's Christian Association organized in 1893 (following an 1891 meeting on the topic hosted by the Brotherhood of Liberty with William A. Hunton, the first YMCA executive of color in the United States).[@wilson_druid_1989, 138] In 1896, a group of African American women founded the Colored Young Women's Christian Association (CYWCA) likely inspired by the movement to promote "racial uplift activity associated with the emergence in the mid-1890s of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs."[@bowling_how_2002]  Another example is the Women's Cooperative Civic League formed in 1913 "at the request of a group of white citizens to address housing, health, sanitation, and educational problems resulting from the rapid urban growth." Led by Sara Fernandis, the organization divided responsibility for different wards of the city among a group of community activists and grew their membership to 130 by 1914.[@gordon_african_1997, 124]

One of the most significant of these organizations was the interracial Baltimore Urban League. Historian Ralph L. Pearson quotes a 1950 Urban League publication that traces the group's founding to the 1919 Hague Conference on World Friendship "which
was the first volunteer gathering of representatives from the warring nations
after World War I."[@pearson_national_1977, 523] As the group began to organize they enlisted the assistance of the National Urban League's Department of Research and
Investigations to conduct a three-month study of Baltimore industries and black workers
beginning in March 1922.[@pearson_national_1977, 524] The study found that 62 of the 175 industrial plants they investigated, employing 20,735 people, refused to hire African American workers. The study led to a meeting at the Emmanuel Church Parish House on May 7, 1924 to formally establish a local Urban League chapter.[@pearson_national_1977, 529] Over the next few years, the new organization directed by R. Maurice Moss, a white social worker, helped to promote the development of Provident Hospital; conducted a survey of housing conditions in the area of bounded by Druid Hill and Pennsylvania avenues, Biddle and Preston streets (the so-called "Lung Block"); and organized a black division of the Playground Athletic League.[@pearson_national_1977, 532]

### Improving conditions for black teachers and students

One important example of the changes that took place in this period were the efforts that led to the publication of the Strayer Survey evaluating the condition and management of Baltimore school both white and black.

Advocates for black students won a key fight for the city to hire black teachers with the appointment of Roberta B. Sheridan in 1888 and, by 1907, not a single white teacher worked in the Baltimore City Division of Colored Schools.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 14] However, many of the city's segregated black schools operated out of older buildings with fewer resources than white schools. Of the eighteen schools open to African American students in 1900 many were built before the Civil War, including School No. 116 at Druid Hill Avenue near Biddle Street (1842); School No. 109 at Fremont and King Streets (1843); and School No. 101 at Jefferson Street near Caroline Street (1855).[@johnson_strayer_2012, 15]

The Maryland State Teachers Association (also known as the Maryland Progressive State Colored Teachers Association) (**Note:** I need to double-check that these are the same entity.) campaigned in 1915 to extend the school year for black students who had a shorter school year than white students.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 18] Some observers saw the absence of any African American members of the Baltimore City School Board as a barrier to addressing  unequal pay and lack of training for teachers and the inadequate school buildings they worked in. In 1919, when the editors of the _Baltimore Afro-American Newspaper_ demanded Charles Koch, the superintendent of schools, hire an African American superintendent, Koch responded that:

>Blacks were not far enough developed to have a school board member, but would do well as members of the street cleaning force.[@farrar_baltimore_1998, 36]

The Strayer Survey was a comprehensive look at the problems of Baltimore's public schools: overcrowding, inadequate facilities, poor curriculum, and out-dated management practices.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 23] When the report was published in 1922 it offered the possibility of "a real opportunity for the segregated schools to participate in much needed school reform".[@johnson_strayer_2012, 36] Among the recommendations was the suggestion that the schools open all trade and apprenticeship programs to black students.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 34] However, although the white school leadership did not promise any immediate action the report did result in the hiring of the first black Director of the Baltimore City Division of Colored Schools, Dr. Francis Russell, in 1923.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 37] After Russell was denied the resources for the administration of his program, he resigned in August 1924. Angelina Johnson describes the appointment of Russell's successor:

>On August 1, 1925, Francis Marion Wood was appointed supervisor of all African American schools of Baltimore City; he would stay in the position until 1943, overseeing many changes. With a starting salary of $4200 per school year, Wood relocated to Baltimore with his wife Nellie and their four children. Wood‘s position included the responsibility for implementing and overseeing the recommendations of the Strayer Report. Supervisor Wood reported to David Weglein, who was Superintendent of Public Instructions and who reported to the nine members of the Board of School Commissioners, the Mayor, and the Baltimore City Council.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 40]

Wood continued to work for the schools up until 1943 overseeing many significant changes in that period. Around the same time, the Defense League (a group of black activist lawyers) won a temporary injunction from a Baltimore Court in June 1925 requiring equal salaries for white and black teachers; later overturned by a higher court but prompted promise from Mayor Howard Jackson in October 1926 to begin equal salaries in the 1927 school year.[@farrar_baltimore_1998, 33]

## Expansion of voting rights for women

The ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920 was a tremendously significant change in the history of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore and around the country. However, winning the right to vote was just one of the ways that black women were growing in power and visibility as activists and organizers during this period. The new opportunities women won through their own activism and political victories helped shape the Civil Rights movement throughout the twentieth century.

Following the 1890 merger of the National Woman Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association, (which formed the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA)), the suffrage movement began to work to exclude black women in a bid to win more support from white Southern women and political leaders. This exclusion contributed to the organization of the Colored Women's League in Washington, D.C. in June 1892. In 1896, the Colored Women's League merged with the National Federation of African American Women to form the National Association of Colored Women.^[Summary based on [this Wikipedia article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_woman_suffrage_movement).]

In October 1905, a mass meeting of 100 women at the Perkins Square Baptist Church (a building later demolished for Murphy Homes) rallying in opposition to the proposal in that year to disenfranchise black voters.[@_they_1905] The rally followed a letter in the _Afro Afro-American_ by W.M. Alexander urging black women to join the fight against the disenfranchisement proposal:

>We also appeal to colored women to do their part. The advocates of the Poe-amendment are urging the white women to help them and since the object of the amendment is to deprive colored men of civil and political liberties, colored women ought to do what they can to defeat it.[@alexander_letter_1905]

In Maryland, the suffrage movement began to grow in the early twentieth century and, in 1909, an activist named Edith Houghton Hooker organized the Just Government League and affiliated her organization with NAWSA. In March of that year, Hooker hosted a meeting where Rev. Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National American Suffrage Association, spoke. The _Baltimore Sun_ reported:

>That all the leaders in the movement for woman suffrage do not extend their desire for women to vote to include all "colored sisters" was made evident last night by the two most conspicuous figures at the meeting of the Equal Suffrage League of Baltimore, in Friends' Meeting House, on Park avenue.[@_apposes_1909]

In 1910, a proposal to grant suffrage to women was defeated in the Maryland General Assembly and Hooker and her allies turned to focus on a national constitutional amendment. A number of suffragist organizations, Carrie Chapman Catt's League of Women Voters and the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (late known as the National Woman's Party) led by Alice Paul, sought support for a national ammendment from southern white political leaders and argued that suffrage for women would not challenge the white supremacist agenda of disenfranchising black voters.^[See [The Nineteenth Amendment: African American Women Suffrage Granted and Restricted in the South](https://books.google.com/books?id=b8zVVp8qJ5sC&lpg=PA427&dq=ratification%20vote%20totals%20nineteenth%20amendment&pg=PA424#v=onepage&q=ratification%20vote%20totals%20nineteenth%20amendment&f=false) (p.424-425) from _The African American Electorate_ by Hanes Walton Jr, Sherman Puckett, Donald R Deskins Jr.]

Black women organized independently to support their churches and communities as well as pursue political goals. Felicia L. Jamison attributes the rise of female leadership within Sharp Street United Methodist Church to work that women put towards "defraying the newly acquired $70,000 debt for the new edifice" erected in 1898.[@jamison_leading_2010] In 1910, the N.M. Carroll Chapter of Sharp Street Church's Epworth League opened a coffee shop and soup house in the Windsor Flats section of Baltimore.[@jamison_leading_2010, 83] A similar mission drove the organization of the Colored Empty Stocking and Fresh Air Circle, a society that was established after the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904 to help Baltimore‘s dependent children.[@neverdon-morton_self-help_1982, 219] Historian Cynthia Neverdon-Morton argues that the significance of this effort is seen, in part, by the interdenominational character of their work where church women throughout the city, "regardless of class or level of education, worked together in a number of social and charitable organizations to better their community."[@jamison_leading_2010, 80]

<!-- FIXME: Double-check the page number for the reference to Neverdon-Morton. The quote is Jamison referencing Neverdon-Morton – I need to go back and review the original. -->

In 1906, a group of black women in Baltimore organized the Federation of the Colored Women of Maryland.[@jenifer_forum._1906] In 1911, the _Afro American_ reported:

>For the first time in the political history of Maryland, the Negro women of the city have been organized into a campaign committee for the purpose of working for the success of the Republican ticket.

The new "Auxiliary Republican Committee" was chaired by Dr. Ernest Lyon and met at 414 W. Hoffman Street. The group was allied with the Anti-Digges Amendment League, an organization of "several hundred Negro women" with the mother of City Councilman Harry S. Cummings serving as president.[@_women_1911]

In August 1916, Bethel A.M.E. Church hosted the tenth biennial meeting of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs.[@_meeting_1916]  In 1919, under the leadership of Rev. M. J. Naylor, Sharp Street Church established a community program that "included a kindergarten, a day nursery, and an employment bureau."[@jamison_leading_2010, 41] Efforts by female activists at Sharp Street Church culminated in the construction of the Sharp Street Community House "a church-affiliated community center that housed young and poverty stricken women, and offered professional classes to the Baltimore black community."[@jamison_leading_2010, 5] Jamison quotes the Community House Annual Report for 1921-1922, which describes how the Community House sought:

>[to] provide a higher civic and social life, to institute and maintain educational and philanthropic enterprises and to investigate and improve conditions generally through co-operation with other social agencies.[@jamison_leading_2010, 6]

In 1919, Maryland's Senators split over the issue of women's suffrage with Democrat John Walter Smith voting against the amendment and Republican Senator Joseph I. France voting for it. When the measure came before the Maryland legislature on February 24, 1920, they rejected the amendment; in part due to concerns over the expansion of suffrage to black women at a time when many white Marylanders still wanted to see more restrictions on voting rights for African Americans. Despite this rejection, the Nineteenth Amendment was finally ratified on August	26, 1920.

On November 2, 1920, women voted for first time in Maryland and, in 1921, the Women's Suffrage League of Maryland affiliated with the recently formed League of Women Voters of the United States. In 1920, the Colored Women's YWCA became an official chapter of the Baltimore YWCA.

On November 7, 1922, a state (?) Constitutional amendment (Chapter 275, Acts of 1922) was ratified making women eligible to hold public office.
