## Introduction

Baltimore's Civil Rights movement changed dramatically in the thirty-five year period between the beginning of the Great Depression in October 1929 and the federal legislative victories of the 1960s. The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were the result of decades of local organizing and advocacy around electoral politics, housing and transportation, public accommodation, education, employment, and criminal injustice in Baltimore and comunities around the country.

For Baltimore's Black schools, the 1921 Strayer Report had prompted only limited improvements to the frustration of students and families. But, the NAACP's legal strategy on school segregation showed the possibility of change: winning the admission of Donald Murray to the University of Maryland and the equalization of Black and White teacher salaries statewide. Criminal injustice remained a key concern as a mass movement of Baltimore residents supported national anti-lynching advocacy in the 1930s and protested police violence at the 1942 March on Annapolis.

After the end of World War II, an interracial student movement, largely led in Baltimore by students from Morgan State College, waged a disruptive and highly visible campaign to overturn decades of segregationist policies. The rhetoric of The rhetoric of American democracy and post-war consumer politics were powerful tools for Black activists, and some White liberal allies, whose protests and activism dismantled countless Jim Crow policies at parks, pools, recreational facilities, and consumer spaces, such as lunch counters, restaurants, and department stores in the 1940s and 1950s. The 1954 Supreme Court decision in *Brown v. Board of Education* created additional opportunities for Black Baltimoreans to challenge Jim Crow policies in Baltimore City and across the state of Maryland.

White reaction to public housing for Black tenants in the 1940s, school desegregation in the 1950s, and open housing in the 1960s revealed the persistent role of racism in shaping local and national politics. By the end of the 1960s, White liberals, including Mayor Theodore McKeldin, struggled unsuccessfully against this reaction. At the local, state, and federal level, this White reaction limited the scope and effectiveness of many efforts to reduce racial inequality, ultimately frustrating civil rights activists and thousands of Black Baltimoreans alike. 

### Freedom and the New Deal: 1929–1941

For Black Baltimoreans, already burdened by employment discrimination and segregated housing, the national economic crisis following the "Black Tuesday" stock market crash on October 29, 1929 brought widespread job loss and even deeper poverty.<!-- Add some figures from the Urban League report?--> The *Afro-American* newspaper neatly summarized the local role of White racism and racial segregation in 1933 when their writers labelled Baltimore a "border city with Southern feelings."[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 11] Decades of legal and political advocacy by the Brotherhood of Liberty through the early twentieth century prevented the mass disenfranchisement found in other Southern towns and cities. But, despite efforts by the new local branch of the NAACP, discriminatory policies and racial prejudice by White leadership frustrated the ambitions of Black Baltimoreans seeking equal treatment by the city, state, or private employers.

From the outset of the Great Depression and through the beginning of World War II, Black residents responded to these challenges with a renewed campaign of protests, fighting for fair administration of criminal justice, equal employment, and equal access to education. At times joined by some White anti-racists and progressive reformers, notably including White Communists and, after 1935, labor organizers with the [Congress of Industrial Organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations) (CIO) as they organized to seek better conditions and more equitable hiring.^[White Communist support for the freedom movement is seen in the formation of the American Negro Labor Congress in 1925. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Party_USA_and_African_Americans) for additional background on the Communist Party and Black people in the United States.] The years between 1930 and 1934, historian Andor Skotnes argues, were "a particularly fluid and experimental period during which various groupings" of both labor and freedom movements "worked closely together."[@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 6]

Young Black people, frustrated by the difficulty of finding work in the early years of the Great Depression, played key role in the renewal of the local movement. In October 1931, two sisters, eighteen-year-old Juanita and twenty-year-old Virginia Jackson, responded to the shortage of jobs for Black young people by organizing the City-Wide Young People's Forum at Sharp Street Church at Dolphin and Etting Streets. Famed Black educator and activist [Nannie Helen Burroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nannie_Helen_Burroughs) (1879–1961) later called the Forum, "the best, most progressive, and analytical organization of Negro young people in America. It feels, thinks, believes, acts."[@ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 42]

Around the same time, a series of brutal lynchings pushed residents towards more militant activism and encouraged the growth of a mass movement. The trial and execution of Euel Lee in 1932 and 1933 led to significant protests over inequitable sentencing and inadequate protection for Black defendants.[@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 57-64] The brutal lynching of George Armwood on October 18, 1933 following his transfer from the Baltimore City Jail to Princess Anne, the seat of Somerset County on Maryland's Eastern Shore horrified but did not surprise Black Baltimoreans. The attack galvanized Black support for proposed federal anti-lynching legislation.[@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 119-139] In the defense of Euel Lee and the response to Armwood's murder, Communists were among the most visible White allies with attorney Bernard Ades and the [International Labor Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labor_Defense), a legal advocacy organization associated with the Communist International, taking a prominent role in Lee's defense and in anti-lynching activism.[@INTERRACIALGROUPDEMANDS1933;@ExclusiveAfroCoverage1933; @INTERRACIALGROUPRAPS1933; @SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 62-64]

Young Black activists used a broad array of tactics—public meetings, letter-writing campaigns, and newspaper editorials, and picket lines—to pressure elected officials and business owners to change discriminatory policies. Leveraging the popularity of the City-Wide Young People's Forum, in September 1933, Juanita and Virginia's mother, [Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillie_Mae_Carroll_Jackson) worked with twenty-five-year-old lawyer Thurgood Marshall, and others to recruit hundreds of young people<!-- Check numbers and ages. --> to picket businesses on the 1700 block of Pennsylvania Avenue that refused to hire Black workers. A lawsuit by business-owners to bar further protests brough the "Buy Where You Can Work" campaign to an abrupt end. However, the campaign resulted in a new relationship between Lillie Carroll Jackson and the Baltimore NAACP branch. With encouragement from *Afro-American* newspaper editor Carl Murphy and attorney [Charles Hamilton Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hamilton_Houston), Lillie C. Jackson took over as the president of the branch in 1935 and remained in that position for thirty-five years.[@FarrarSeeWhatAfro1983, 90-92; @SkotnesBuyWhereYou1994; @TyrusProphetKiowaCostonie2002; @SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 140-162] 

While the NAACP's local leadership were among the most visible advocates of civil rights for Black Baltimoreans, the organization relied on a large number of people who supported the nascent movement by giving money or volunteering time and services. For example, without any paid staff, the branch relied volunteers such as the board secrtary (a position most often held by a woman before 1935). Between 1930 and 1934, Mary Cook volunteered as secretary and lived at 1422 McCulloh Street—just a few blocks away from Jackson and the Sharp Street Church.[@SartainBordersEqualityNAACP2013, 51-52]

### WWII and "Double V" Campaign: 1941–1954

The beginning of the war in Europe in 1939 and the United States declaration of war in response to the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor led to the formation of new coalitions campaigning to change policies and public opinion around Jim Crow discrimination and segrgeation. For Black residents facing high rents for rooms in overcrowded houses and brutal unjust policing in the city's segregated Black neighborhoods, the need for change was clear. *Afro-American* editor Carl Murphy joined other Black newspaper editors and activists in pushing the "Double V" campaign seeking victory over fascism in Europe and victory over injustice at home in the United States. In editorials and reporting in their local and national editions, the newspaper labeled Jim Crow segregation and discrimination as "Hitlerism" in a fight to influence public opinion.[@TerryTrampingjusticedismantling2002, 76-79; @FarrarSeeWhatAfro1983, 171]

By the end of the 1930s, Baltimore activists with the local NAACP, the Baltimore Urban League, and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) worked in concert with a growing national alliance dedicated to the rights of workers and Black Americans. In December 1940, the CIO and partners launched a campaign to force the [Glenn L. Martin Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_L._Martin_Company) in Baltimore County, one of the region's largest wartime defense contractors, to begin training and hiring Black skilled workers. The campaign, linked to the [March on Washington Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_Movement) organized by [A. Philip Randolph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Philip_Randolph) and [Bayard Rustin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayard_Rustin), helped pushed President Roosevelt to sign [Executive Order 8802](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_8802) on June 25, 1941—just days before the scheduled march in Washington, D.C. The order prohibited discriminatory hiring in war-time industries and established the Fair Employment Practices Commission to enforce the new law. Thirty-year-old Clarence Mitchell (who had reported on George Armwood's lynching for the *Afro-American* in 1934) joined the new commission as the associate director of field operations. By October 1941, the local activists had succeeded in forcing the Martin Company to meet their demands.[@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 301-304]

![Manpower: Negro bomber plant workers, 1942. U.S. Office of War Information. Courtesy New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture Photographs and Prints Division]({{ "/assets/images/nypl.digitalcollections.510d47de-8195-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99.001.w.jpg" | absolute_url }})

The power of a unified and militant Black community is further illlustrated by the March on Annapolis in 1942. On February 7, 1942, a Baltimore City police officer shot and killed Thomas Broadus, a black U.S. Army private from Pittsburgh. Outraged by the attack, the Asco Club, a local Black social organization, appointed Dr. John E.T. Camper to seek help from Lillie M. Jackson and the Baltimore NAACP to investigate the killing. Camper later recalled:

>I got fighting mad when I found how little the rights of colored people are respected, even by the law which is designed to protect them… and what's more I've been mad ever since.[@HarlestonYOURNEIGHBORBrief1943]

Jackson, Camper, and other activists formed the Citizen's Committee for Justice (chaired by Carl Murphy) and planned a march to protest the mistreatment of Black residents by Baltimore police officers. Criminal injustice was a concern that brought together Black Baltimoreans from a wide range of religious and professional backgrounds. Physical proximity also played a role in enabling successful organizing. Dr. John E.T. Camper lived at 639 N. Carey Street, just a few blocks west of Providence Baptist Church, whose pastor Reverend E.W. White served as secretary to the Citizen's Committee. Lillie C. Jackson's home at 1226 Druid Hill Avenue doubled as offices for the Citizen's Committee and the NAACP. Edward S. Lewis, executive secretary of the Urban League, lived at 1538 Division Street and worked out of an office at 1841 Pennsylvania Avenue.

On April 24, 1942, over two thousand Baltimoreans rode charter buses, shared cars for the drive, and even walked to the State House in Annapolis for a hearing with the Governor Herbert R. O’Conor. Voluntary contributions of eight hundred dollars covered the transportation costs for the people traveling to Annapolis and the crowd gathered with a reportedly "serious, sober attitude."[@Berry000BaltimoreCitizens1942]

Much of the testimony focused on criminal injustice and the Baltimore police. Edward S. Lewis explained on how Baltimore Police Commissioner Robert F. Stanton had ignored the "repeated efforts of citizens… to initiate preventive crime measures." Rev. E.W. White, a recent president of the Inter-denominational Ministers' Alliance, described how "colored people in Baltimore are inadequately and unjustly policed" and asked Governor O’Conor to appoint "colored policeman in uniform." Lillie C. Jackson echoed White's message in asking for "appointment of another colored policewoman" (the first Black non-uniformed police officer, Violet Hill Whyte, was hired in July 1937). W.A.C. Hughes, Jr., attorney for the NAACP, sought an investigation of police killings in Baltimore. [Linwood G. Koger](http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/015200/015298/html/15298bio.html), an attorney, World War I veteran, and head of the Walter Green Post of the American Legion, asked the Governor to appoint a "colored magistrate." Donald Boyce, 10th Ward Committeeman for the Republican City Committee, asked directly for the removal of Commissioner [Robert F. Stanton](http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/014400/014416/html/14416bio.html).

Donald Boyce, a resident at 1419 E. Madison Street, was one of several east Baltimore residents testifying at the hearing. Reverend George A. Crawley,  leader of Saint Paul Baptist Church and president of the United Baptists of Maryland, lived at 1418 E. Biddle Street, asked for "all colored staff and membership on [the] board of the [Crownsville State Hospital for Insane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crownsville_Hospital_Center)"<!-- Double-check this quote. --> (established as the Hospital for the Negro Insane of Maryland in 1910). Dr. Ralph Young, lived at 1429 E. Monument Street, asked for Black participation on the Maryland Tuberculosis Commission, telling the Governor "we need to have a part in administration of our own institutions." Carl Murphy testified on discrimination in the defense industry,  Mrs. Virgie Waters, president of the the Beauticians' Association, "urged representation on the State board" regulating beauticians, and twenty-one year-old [Harry A. Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_A._Cole), a junior at Morgan College and later the first Black person elected to the Maryland State Senate, simply "spoke for youth."[@Berry000BaltimoreCitizens1942]

The March on Annapolis was the largest freedom demonstration in Maryland history and it led Governor O'Conor to appoint the statewide Commission on Problems Affecting the Negro Population to consider the protestors concerns.[@TerryTrampingjusticedismantling2002, 91-100] The organizing abilities and financial support on display at the Maryland State House helped make Baltimore's civil rights movement "increasingly grassroots in character" during the late 1930s and early 1940s.^[@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 287-289; Neighborhood associations (combined with Lillie C. Jackson's Methodist beliefs) also made anti-tavern activism a major issue for the NAACP in the 1930s and 1940s.]<!--Very good information in Skotnes on the religious and civic motivations of the anti-tavern activism and on the role of neighborhood associations in supporting the organization.--> In addition, frustration with O'Conor's limited response to the protest prompted activists to invest time and money in extensive voter registration efforts in the early 1940s.

The Baltimore NAACP's political organizing helped liberal Republican Theodore McKeldin win office as Mayor in November 1942. As Mayor from 1943 to 1947, McKeldin lent his support to many long-sought demands by Black Baltimoreans. For example, in March 1944, Mayor McKeldin appointed George McMechen, NAACP activist and attorney, as the first Black person to serve on the Baltimore school board.[@BaumBrownBaltimore2011, 43] Unfortunately for his supporters, McKeldin's first campaign for Maryland Governor in 1946 was unsuccessful. Governor William Preston Lane, Jr.—who was the state attorney general when a group of White Marylanders lynched George Armwood thirteen years earlier—unsurprisingly, did little to change the state's approach to civil rights.

After World War II ended in 1945, the landscape of race and activism began to quickly change as Black residents began purchasing homes in formerly segregated White neighborhoods west of Fulton Avenue. The 1948 U.S. Supreme Court decision in *[Shelley v. Kraemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_v._Kraemer)* made the deed restrictions keeping out Black residents unenforceable and the crowding in segregated Black neighborhoods made Black households more willing to risk the antagonism of White neighbors in order to purchase a home for their family.[@TerryTrampingjusticedismantling2002, 198-201] At the same time, suburban builders began to put up huge numbers of new homes in Baltimore County with support from the Federal Housing Administration. Only White households could access these mortgages or suburban neighborhoods.<!-- NOTE: Incorporate notes from Hirsch on the federal role for housing in this period. --> At the same time, anti-Communist attacks by the local and federal government undermined the regional workers' movement and, Skotnes observed, "antiracist struggle within the unions ebbed and the alliance with the freedom movement deteriorated."[@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 314]<!-- End this section with a mention about late 1940s protests like the Ford's Theatre campaign. -->

### Brown in Baltimore: 1954-1965

Baltimore City had also started taking tentative steps towards change in the early 1950s under [Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_D%27Alesandro_Jr.) (who served as mayor from 1947 to 1959). For example, in August 1951, the city school board opened Polytechnic High School at Calvert Street and North Avenue to Black students on a limited basis.[@TempletonAdmissionNegroBoys1954; @ThomsenIntegrationBaltimorePolytechnic1983]<!-- This move followed legal action by the NAACP -->

In 1950, Governor Lane survived a bruising primary challenge by Democratic candidate George P. Mahoney (running on an anti-tax platform) but lost to Theodore McKeldin in the general election.[@HardestyveilvoodooGeorge2008, 47-51; @SmithHereLiesJim2008, 102] Between 1951 and 1959, Governor McKeldin again delivered for Black supporters by establishing the Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations in 1951 and ending segregation at most state parks in 1953.^[The desegregation of state parks excluded public pools and beaches until 1955]<!-- Clarify and double-check this. -->

The governor's support for civil rights played an important role in ending a five year protest campaign against racially segregated seating at Ford's Theatre on Fayette Street started by Morgan State students in 1948.<!--Was it 1948? Or February 1947?--> Years of picket lines organized by the Baltimore NAACP, actor and audience boycotts, and pressure from Governor McKeldin finally forced the desegregation of the prominent downtown Baltimore theater in 1953.[@SmithHereLiesJim2008, 104-106; @TerryTrampingjusticedismantling2002, 270-274] But the incremental approach promoted by McKeldin and Baltimore's White liberals could not be sustained long. The Supreme Court's *Brown* decision and an increasingly active student movement brought new pressure on elected officials to dismantle Jim Crow policies in Maryland much more quickly.

The Baltimore Urban League provided another vehicle for interracial activism; avoiding protest in favor of negotiating directly with local businesses and segregated union locals to change discriminatory practices. For example, in 1951, the Urban League worked with the Yellow Cab Company and the AFL Taxicab Operators Union to get the company to begin hiring Black drivers. In the spring of 1952, the Urban League convinced the Baltimore Transit Company and AFL Transit Workers Union to get the company to begin hiring Black bus drivers and streetcar operators.[@CannonEFFORTHIRINGNEGROES1953]<!-- What about integration of Baltimore Polytechnic? See also photos of Gwynn Oak protests http://darkroom.baltimoresun.com/2013/07/let-freedom-ring-the-desegregation-of-gwynn-oak-amusement-park/#2 -->

Young activists continued to push the pace and goals of the local and national civil rights movements.<!-- Repetitive. --> In Baltimore, Black and White teenagers protested segregation at parks and recreational facilities in the 1940s.[@Schustercityswingset2011]<!-- NOTE: Insert mention of the Druid Hill Park protest in 1948? --> In an effective use of the nonviolent sit-in protest strategy,<!-- Add a comment on this being early or not? --> between 1953 and 1955, students from Morgan State University joined members of the local chapter of the [Congress of Racial Equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Racial_Equality) (CORE) for a series of nonviolent sit-ins at "five-and-dime" lunch counters on the 200 block of W. Lexington Street and at Northwood Shopping Center to protest discrimination against Black diners.^[CORE was an interracial activist organization established in Chicago in 1942.]<!-- Mention the role of local and national chains in extending small wins into big wins. Add a mention of CORE distributing this as a case study and possibly inspiring the Woolworth sit-in. -->

The gathering momentum and urgency of the movement after the Supreme Court decision in *Brown v. Board* helped secure the passage of the [Civil Rights Act of 1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957) and the [Civil Rights Act of 1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1960). The 1957 federal voting rights bill was famously filibustered by Democratic Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina but all of Maryland's Senators and Congressional Representatives voted in favor of the bill.^[More details on the [Senate](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/85-1957/s75) and [Congressional votes](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/85-1957/h42) is available on GovTrack.] When it was signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower it was the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction and created the [U.S. Commission on Civil Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Commission_on_Civil_Rights). The Commission—though initially limited to fact-finding—played a key role in documenting injustice. Congress granted the Commission expanded authority under the [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964).^[See [GovTrack](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/88-1964/h182) for votes on the 1964 bill.] Around same time, women also won new protections with the [Equal Pay Act of 1963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Pay_Act_of_1963) and new protections against gender discrimination in the 1964 Civil Rights bill.

Victories at the state level also helped shift policies for Black Baltimoreans. Harry A. Cole won election as the first Black member of the Maryland General Assembly in 1954 and Verda Welcome became the first Black woman elected to the Maryland State Senate in 1962.<!-- Citations missing. Double-check dates. --><!-- Mention role of Cold War politics in changing segregation policy? Who pushed the Maryland legislature to change in 1951? -->

While the significance of the *Brown* decision in undermining the legal basis for segregated public life was increasingly clear, many White Marylanders were intransigent in their support for segregation. In 1960, student activists from Morgan State College, Johns Hopkins University, and Goucher College with Baltimore's Civic Interest Group (CIG) led the push for desegregation at downtown department stores and restaurants on Howard Street including Hutzler's, Stewart's, and Hoschild-Kohn's.[@PalumbosStudentInvolvementBaltimore1999]<!--When was CIG founded? Add a short history of the organization in a footnote.-->

The next year, in 1961, after embarrassing incidents of discrimination against African diplomats at restaurants along U.S. Route 40 in Maryland and Delaware<!--Where?-->, CORE activists saw an opportunity to push for broader change. CORE recruited volunteers from CIG and several other organizations for the "Route 40 Project" to challenge the segregated facilities in a massive Freedom Ride<!-- Capitalization? Where did this take place? --> on November 11, 1960. Just days before the ride began, however, forty-seven restaurants along Route 40 agreed to desegregate thanks to the activists and pressure from President John F. Kennedy's administration. CORE called off the ride but sent the volunteers gathering at D.C.'s Howard University to Baltimore instead where they picketed some of the city's segregated restaurants.<!-- Where? Little Italy and...? -->[@BanksCORERoute402011; @ErdmanEyesworldRacial2007]

Two years later, in July 1963, a large number of White students and pastors joined to protest at Gwynn Oak Amusement Park in Baltimore County. The protest was organized by CORE, the student-led CIG, the NAACP, and the National Council of Churches (NCC).^[@HaspelRollerCoastersCivil2003; @NathanTogetherTakingMerryGoRound2011; White pastors arrested in the protests included Rev. Joseph M. Connolly of the Catholic Interracial Council and Rev. Jack Malpas, of St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church.]<!-- Why mention White pastors in a footnote but not include Black pastors? -->

Later that summer, Black church leaders, business owners, and activists worked to recruit and transport thousands of Baltimore residents to Washington, D.C. in support of the [March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom) in 1963. As a generation earlier, Baltimore's experienced community of activists and proximity to Washington, D.C. helped tie the work of local activists into a broader national agenda.

Despite the sympathies and support from some White Baltimoreans, many more residents used their privleged positions to relocate to segregated White communities in the suburbs. In 1958, the Maryland State Commission on Interracial Problems compared Baltimore to cities like Detroit or Chicago (where violent attacks on new Black neighbors notoriously frequent) and observed that Baltimore's problem "is not with violence but with the frigid withdrawal" of White residents.[@OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994, 133-136] White and Black activists recognized the challenges presented by persistent housing segregation in the Baltimore region early on. One important organization for these efforts, Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc., was founded in 1959 by James Rouse, Ellsworth Rosen, and Sidney Hollander, Jr. to education residents about fair housing laws and push for stronger policies. But both local and federal policies played a major role in frustrating such grassroots efforts.

Thousands of White residents left the city for federally subsidized suburban developments and the population of Baltimore County more than tripled between 1940 and 1960. Baltimore County zoning excluded the development of more affordable multifamily housing.[@McdougallBlackBaltimoreNew1993, 49] The expansion of highways made it easier for White commuters to move away, including the [Jones Falls Expressway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_Falls_Expressway) (I-83) (which began development in 1955) and the Baltimore Beltway (I-695) (which opened in stages between 1955 and 1962).<!-- Citation missing. --> Moreover, Black Baltimoreans were excluded from the suburban migration by mortgage discrimination by private banks and the Federal Housing Administration and exclusionary zoning policies.[@McdougallBlackBaltimoreNew1993, 49]<!-- NOTE: Add citations. -->

Theodore McKeldin took office for his second term as Baltimore's Mayor in 1963, twenty years after the start of his first term. In June 1966, as he struggled to find a way to satisfy both White and Black constituents, McKeldin reflected on the city's still limited progress:<!-- Trim this block quote! Also – note the way it speaks to a White audience when it says "We". -->

> ...while we have moved, we have not moved toward the solution of these problems with the speed and vigor with which we are capable.
> We have not really attempted, as a community, to understand the plight, the unrest, and the feelings of those who have been denied.
> We have not attempted to understand why, even after significant progress, our negro brethren still insist that all is not right nor community – that there is much to be done.[@McKeldinStateMayorTheodore1966]

Thirty-five years after the Young People's Forum began, twenty-four years after the consequential March on Annapolis, and twelve years after the *Brown* decision, Black people in Baltimore continued to struggle against White resistance and racist policies, against employment discrimination, segregated and inadequate housing, unequal educational opportunities, and racist policing. 

## Politics and activism

### New Deal Democrats and Black voters: 1930–1940s

Electoral politics also reemerged as a major source of opportunity for change. A few months before the 1932 election, the *Afro-American* helped to organize a registration drive for Black voters, highlighting the fact that in Baltimore City, "37,908 colored people are registered and ready to vote, and 54,000 of us are slackers and ineligible to cast a ballot because we have not registered."[@GiveBaltimoreNew1932] The drive won supported from former City Council member Walter S. Emerson, leading members of the A.M.E. Church, and, one account noted, "It is expected that leaders in the Socialist and Communist groups will be invited to participate".[@WILLORGANIZENONPARTISAN1932; @REGISTRATIONORGANIZATIONLAUNCHED1932]<!-- Add more information about the City Council in this period. Add more information about statewide politics. -->

In 1934, Baltimore's Black voters helped to defeat long-serving Democratic Maryland Governor Albert Ritchie in favor of Republican Harry Nice.<!-- Add information on the consequences of this election, e.g. first appointment for Black police officers. --> Nice delivered for his constituents with the first appointment of Black police officers to the Baltimore City Police Department.[@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 277-278]

Support for Nice and McKeldin did not reverse the major realignment of black voters from the Republican to the Democratic Party. Black voters in northern cities were key to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's reelection in 1936.[@SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009, 225-226]<!--This source is focused on 1936--> In a column on Roosevelt's 1936 election, African American mathematician and writer [Kelly Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Miller_(scientist)) celebrated the end of the "Solid South" control over the Democratic party and called the election a "victory of liberalism over reaction."<!-- Add transition on shift from support for White to Black candidates. --> Baltimore's Clarence Mitchell, however, remained skeptical of the depth of the Roosevelt administration's commitment to equal rights for Black Americans, observing "When you start from a position of zero, even if you move up to a point of two on a scale of twelve, it looks like a big improvement."[@SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009, 226-227]<!-- NOTE: Relocate this sentence. State organization for NAACP formed around 1941, growing out of reorganization and expansion campaign in 1936-1937[@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 272] -->

Black political organizing efforts took place in a variety of public and private spaces. <!-- Examples of spaces for Black power/activism -->Examples include the MeDoSo<!-- Is this short for something? --> Club House (the meeting place for a group of black doctors who donated generously to the NAACP) located in a house at 1800 Eutaw Place. Another example is the Smith Hotel described by the *Sun*, at the time of the building's demolition in July 1957, as "almost a shrine to much of Baltimore's Negro population." The hotel was built in 1912 by Thomas R. Smith and served as a "gathering place for Negro visitors from as far north as New York and as far west as Chicago."[@SmithHotelNoted1957]

In 1943, the same voters helped to defeat Baltimore's long-serving Democratic Mayor Howard W. Jackson in favor of Republican Theodore McKeldin. McKeldin's liberal views on civil rights won him significant support from black voters who including many registered by the NAACP in the group's "Vote for Victory" drive.[@MinistersUrgeNew1943] As Mayor and later Governor, McKeldin was accessible to Black activists in a way that no other White elected official in Baltimore had been before, as Reverend Marion Bascom, a civil rights activist and leader of Douglas Memorial Community Church, noted:

> People didn't have to have a 'sit-in' demonstration to see Mr. McKeldin. Mr. McKeldin was available and this, I think, made all the difference.[@ShoemakerWeShallOvercome1994, 262]<!-- Add in supplementary quotes so this doesn't seem unbalanced in the presentation of McKeldin. -->

### Student movement and interracial organizing: 1940s–1960s

Spaces on campus for organizing, community building, and mutual support were an important resource in fostering the growth of the student movement. One example is Levering Hall at the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University. In 1953, Chester Wickwire accepted a position as the executive secretary of the campus YMCA and the chaplain for the university. At Levering Hall, Wickwire provided "a haven for liberals on an otherwise conservative campus" and ran "ran various student life programs such as concerts, dances, and movie screenings while simultaneously organizing political discussions about civil rights, pacifism, the Cold War, and Vietnam." Wickwire himself was an active participant in the civil rights movement and helped support student activists.<!-- Citation missing! Oral history? -->

Another important site was the Morgan Christian Center, now known as the [Morgan State University Memorial Chapel](https://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/482), which provided a meeting site for Morgan students, clergy and activists from throughout the Baltimore community. Designed by Towson-born African American architect Albert Irvin Cassell, the construction of the center and an adjacent parsonage was intended to preserve the religious roots of Morgan College following the school's 1939 sale to the state of Maryland. Beginning in 1944, the director of the Morgan Christian Center was Rev. Dr. Howard L. Cornish, a 1927 Morgan graduate and math professor, who lived at the parsonage and supported student civil rights activism up until his retirement in 1976.

Youth organizing and activism wasn't limited solely to college campuses, however. For example, in 1955, teenage members, both White and Black, of the regional YMCA held an interracial conference including a session on "Understanding Other Races," where participants signed on to a statement calling for the end of segregated "separate socials" as a "positive step the Hi-Y and Try Hi-Y can take to help abolish prejudice."[@YMCATeenmembers1955]<!-- Add transitions to incorporate this paragraph into the section. -->

### Black elected officials in Baltimore and Maryland: 1950s–1960s

<!-- Linwood Koger won the Republican primary election for the State Senate for the Fourth Legislative District on September 15, 1942 with the backing of a political organization led by Marse Callaway.[@KogerSoleVictor1942] NOTE: Figure out how to explain this as the early history of Black elected officials. -->The Colored Women's Democratic Campaign Committee organized by Victorine Q. Adams (1912–2006) in December 1946 and regular voter registration campaigns by the NAACP in the 1940s.

Such organizing efforts led directly to the election of [Harry A. Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_A._Cole) to the Maryland State Senate in 1954 and [Verda Welcome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verda_Welcome) in 1962. Cole was first African American ever elected to the Maryland Senate and Welcome was the first black woman to be elected to any state senate in the country—key victories for African Americans seeking change through representation in local and state government. However, these victories also reflected a city where Black residents made up a growing share of the electorate as White residents fled to the suburbs.<!--  In 1958, Verda F. Welcome and Irma George Dixon became the first African American women to be elected to the House of Delegates, and, in 1962, Verda Welcome became the first African American woman to be elected to the Maryland Senate.  http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/speccol/4492/html/0000.html -->

### White reaction in politics after WWII: 1950s–1960s

<!-- What about pre 1950 reaction? -->

Racialized suburban growth, or "white flight", functioned as an implicit strategy of White resistance to integration. Between 1950 and 1960, the population of Baltimore County grew by over 80% (from 270,273 to 492,428). In the same ten year period, Baltimore City lost population (dropping from 949,708 to 939,024) while the proportion of African American residents grew (23.70% to 34.67%). Between 1960 and 1970, the population of Baltimore County continued to grow (26.12% to 621,077). Between 1950 and 1970, the population of Anne Arundel County, the population grew by more than 250% (117,392 in 1950 to 206,634 in 1960 to 297,539 in 1970).

White resistance also included more explicit and, at times, violent responses by Americans who sought to maintain the status quo and supported elected officials who ran on their opposition to the civil rights movement. White Baltimoreans in the city and suburbs voted in support of [George C. Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace) (the segregationist Democratic Governor of Alabama) in the 1964 Democratic primary for President and for Barry Goldwater (a Republican Senator and opponent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) in that year's general election.

## Homes, neighborhoods, and transportation

### "Redlining" and federal housing policies: 1930s–1950s

The New Deal and World War II both led to major changes in the relationship of the city and state government to housing and transportation in Baltimore. During the Great Depression, the shortage of new homes for both White and Black buyers kept existing homeowners fixed in place and slowed the process of racial transition that had been underway in west and east Baltimore neighborhoods from the 1880s through the 1920s.  Across the country, housing starts dropped by over 90% from a high of 937,000 in 1925 to 93,000 in 1933.[@HaywardBaltimoreRowhouse2001, 155] Nonetheless, in East Baltimore, Black congregations moved into buildings formerly occupied by White churches as, in 1929, the Episcopalian Church of the Holy Innocents sold its building to Grace Baptist Church and, in 1931, Baltimore's oldest Black Roman Catholic congregation—St. Francis Xavier—purchased the Madison Square M.E. Church.[@HaywardOldEastBaltimore2005, 88]

The lines of segregation were further reinforced by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) (established in 1933) which used infamous "red-lining" maps to discourage lending in neighborhoods where African Americans lived. The [National Housing Act of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Housing_Act_of_1934) created the Federal Housing Administration and the [Housing Act of 1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_Act_of_1937) provided a new source of federal funding for cities like Baltimore to engage in "slum clearance" and build new public housing projects.<!-- Explain how slum clearance affected Black households and housing.  --> These included Edgar Allan Poe Homes (built 1938) and McCulloh Homes (built 1940)—two of the earliest public housing projects for Black Baltimoreans.

Even more significant changes in federal and local policies followed the end of World War II. The U.S. Supreme Court 1948 decision in the case of *[Shelley v. Kraemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_v._Kraemer)* ended the legal enforcement of racial covenants (which had previously been upheld by the Supreme Court in their 1926 decision in *[Corrigan v. Buckley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrigan_v._Buckley)*). While the approval of the [Housing Act of 1949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_Act_of_1949) dramatically expanded access to mortgages for White Baltimoreans, White officials continued to deny equal access for Black residents seeking to purchase homes.

Historian Richard Rothstein, has argued that redlining by the FHA "necessitated the contract sale system for black homeowners unable to obtain conventional mortgages" and "created the conditions for neighborhood deterioration" in historically segregated Black neighborhoods after World War II.[@RothsteinColorLawForgotten2017, 97] Contract buying (and the associated practice of "blockbusting") were reportedly widespread in Baltimore, Chicago, Cincinnati, Detroit, Washington, D.C., and other cities. Rothstein emphasizes the connection between blockbusting and persistent housing segregation, writing:

> Blockbusting could work only because the FHA made certain that African Americans had few alternative neighborhoods where they could purchase homes at fair market values.[@RothsteinColorLawForgotten2017, 97-99]

Critics saw that even as the federal government began to profess support for Black Americans struggling with housing substantive policy changes were still missing. For example, Clarence Mitchell praised [Albert Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_M._Cole), administrator of the federal Housing and Home Finance Agency for his “fine words” at an event in Detroit but noted that Cole avoided “the basic problem.” Mitchell predicted “we shall continue to have the Levittown, Birmingham, and Baltimore type of problem,” officially sanctioned residential segregation, until the federal government adopted a “flat policy” of non-discrimination. [@Hirschlastmostdifficult2005, 14]

### "White flight" and neighborhood stabilization: 1940s–1960s

During the Great Depression, West Baltimore's "color line" had stabilized around Fulton Avenue. Beginning in the late 1940s, however, neighborhoods at the edge of Old West Baltimore began to transition from White to Black. The change was driven by a number of factors including the rapid growth of Baltimore’s African American population during the 1940s and 1950s, the intense overcrowding and deteriorating housing conditions within historically segregated Black neighborhoods, and the movement of White households out of the center city to the areas of new development in the Baltimore suburbs.

From January 1941 to November 1941 alone, housing vacancies for units open to Black occupancy shrank from .8% to .1%. In a letter to Mayor McKeldin in July 1945, in response to the efforts by a group of 350 residents in the Fulton Avenue area to prevent Black residents from moving west, the NAACP argued "growth demands that we take in those streets that fringe our area since every attempt to enter new sections is vigorously denied." The Citizens Committee for Justice and the Baltimore Urban League observed "the need for more housing is most sharply felt in the Negro community, where there are virtually no vacancies of any type."[@MayorDiscussesNegro1945]

When Black residents began responding to this housing crisis by purchasing homes in formerly segregated White neighborhoods, some White resident met them with violence. In 1945, a group of people, described by the *Afro American* as "hoodlums who resented having the Millers move into a white neighborhood," threw bricks at the home of James Miller and his family at 816 N. Fulton Avenue, breaking glass in the front door and windows.[@FultonAvenueHome1945] The newspaper expanded on this account writing:

> Of at least fifty houses on Fulton Avenue now owned by colored persons between the 500 and 1800 blocks, only one case of violence has been reported by one of the three families now known to occupy homes there. The James Miller family, which moved into 816 N. Fulton Avenue on February 15, reported that bricks were thrown through a window and door panel on the following Saturday. The second floor of this house is occupied by the William Montgomery family… Among Fulton Avenue property owners are the Rev. Hiram J. Smith, Dr. Bruce Alleyne and the Medicos Club, an organization of physicians and dentists. "For Sale" signs may be seen all along Fulton Avenue.[@50HomesOwned1945]

Dr. Ed Orser quotes one black West Baltimore resident recalling the experience of White flight in the late 1940s:

> Black people started moving out of the confined areas somewhere around 1947 or 1948, but what would happen was that whites would evacuate a block or two blocks, and black people would move in. The evacuation would take place first. I remember streets like Fulton Avenue, Monroe Street—they were once totally white, and they went through the transition and changed somewhere between 1946 and 1949—that was the time I was in service. When I went in, there were no black people when I came out, there they were black streets… But it wasn’t integration… it was an evacuation.[@OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994, 68]

The process of this rapid transition is closely associated with negative accounts of realtors, often known as "block-busters," using a range of tactics to take advantage of both White sellers and black buyers. For example, during the 1940s and 1950s many African American households purchased a home under land-installment contracts or buy-like-rent arrangements, also known as lease option contracts, that allowed home-owners to purchase property without an initial down payment or closing charges. However, these arrangements did not immediately transfer title to the property and the contract could still be terminated if the new home-owner missed a single payment. Although home-ownership rate for Black residents by 194% between 1940 and 1950, in comparison to 58.8% for White residents, a 1955 survey by the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations found that 53% of respondents had purchased their homes through contract buying arrangements rather than regular financing.[@OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994, 91] <!-- This citation doesn't include the increase in homeownership rates although it may be on another page of Orser. -->

According to an interview with Antero Pietella, in 1947, Thomas Cripps witnessed a man with suit in the area around his home at 2323 Mosher Street carrying signs "This House is Not for Sale," with the implication that the neighborhood was imminently threatened with transition. Cripps' family became the first household on the block to sell their property to a black family when they sold their home in 1949 to Ellsworth F. Davage, a Baltimore County school teacher, and his wife Elizabeth.[@PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010, 102-103] These initial movements soon accelerated, particularly in west and northwest areas of Baltimore.

In August 1948, a house on the 1300 block of Payson Street just to the north of the district was subject to an arson attempt, attributed to retaliation against a White Jewish home-owner who had "broken" the block by selling a property to an African American homeowner in 1946.[@RacialHatredBlamed1948] 

An October 1948 editorial in the *Sun* described the "colored section of most cities" as "already dangerously overcrowded" and noted that only 2% of new housing built in Baltimore in 1948 was open to Black occupants, despite representing 20% of Baltimore’s total population.[@SmallProportionNew1948]

Lula Jones Garrett, a columnist for the _Baltimore Afro_, observed in a column titled "Change-the-Address New Game on Baltimore Front" writing in 1949:

> What with the local yokels forsaking the ghettos and moving into swankier mansions, it takes a special edition of the directory to locate your best friends these days."[@GarrettChangetheAddressNewGame1949]

By 1950, Baltimore had 226,053 Black residents, representing 23.8% of the population but occupying only 19.4% of the city's dwelling units. This pattern continued into the early 1950s: of the 53,000 permits issued for new homes in the Baltimore metropolitan area from 1950 to 1953, only 3,200 were open to Black households, even as the Black population increased another 10%.<!-- Citation missing! --> In July 1950 after Ms. Beatrice Sessoms, a native of North Carolina who came to Baltimore two years earlier, moved with her nephew to the 2300 block of Lauretta Avenue, her house was attacked.[@HomeBuyerStanding1950]



Although Baltimore evidently avoided widespread physical violence on a scale comparable to Detroit or Chicago, the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems observed in 1958, "The problem it said, is not with violence 'but with the frigid withdrawal' of whites from the Negroes." During the late 1950s, the State Commission and others finally engaged with the ongoing process of racial transition with the beginning of advocacy and organizing efforts to promote "neighborhood stabilization."[@NEGROGAINSSEEN1958]

The issue reached Edmondson Village around 1955, when the first black residents moved west of the Gwynns Falls to live in the southeast corner of the region, around the western end of the Baltimore Street Bridge. One White resident, Alice Hughes, remarked on the experience, in an interview with scholar Ed Orser:

> When the [black] people started moving into the neighborhood, they did come in, literally block by block. I can recall when they came across the… bridge, everybody was very upset; they said, "Oh my God, they're over the bridge now; our street will be next."[@OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994, 98]

In April 1958, an Edmondson Village improvement group organized its annual meeting at School No. 88 located at Wildwood Parkway and Gelston Drive, hosting Chief Judge Delany Foster of the Orphans Court of Baltimore as the guest speaker. In July 1958, the association's president L.E. Larsen gave the association's support to a plan sponsored by the Baltimore Urban League, the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations, and the Citizens Planning and Housing Association to "combat the conversion of Baltimore areas from all-white to all-Negro occupancy." Larsen observed that Edmondson Village:

> already faced with pressure from block-busting realtor tactics and population shifts… the exodus from the city of the stable core of responsible citizens will likely be accelerated and the inevitable consequences will be a set-back to many of the long-range plans now being developed and implemented.[@POPULATIONSHIFTFOUGHT1958]

An African American resident in this period later shared her experience in an oral history with Dr. Ed Orser, remarking:

> When we first moved to the neighborhood, it was more white – we were just about the second black family on this block... We could see the changes, because when we moved, there were so many sale signs all around, and it did make a difference in the neighborhood, because there was a change, and you had to get yourself adjusted to the people who were moving in, and you couldn't really know the ones who were moving out, because they were leaving so fast, so we were really going through a transitional stage. People were moving in and out overnight; you didn't really know who your neighbors were. It was a difficult period, because when we moved, we thought maybe the neighborhood would be stabilized; it just wasn't.[@OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994, 151]

By 1960, however, the area south of Edmondson Village had changed from more than 99% White in 1950 to 62% black in 1960 and, a decade later, 92% black in 1970. Edmondson Village itself remained 99% White in 1960 but had changed to 97% black by 1970.[@OrserBlockbustingBaltimoreEdmondson1994, 118-122] <!-- Double-check citation from the Edmondson Village National Register nomination. --><!-- NOTE: Is this the origins of Baltimore Neighbors, Inc?

### Highway building and transportation planning: 1930s–1960s

The issue of highway construction and its disparate impact on Black neighborhoods began to take shape in this period. At the most basic level, White households were more likely to own cars than African American households.<!-- FIXME: Citation needed! --><!-- Insert transition. -->

A series of road building and widening projects in the 1930s and 1940s brought increased noise and automotive traffic to largely black neighborhoods. Examples include the construction of the Howard Street extension and bridge over the Jones Falls in 1938 (displacing a large number African American households) and the initial expansion of Druid Lake Drive in 1947 (Druid Lake Drive expanded again in 1964 despite significant opposition from nearby residents).[@WatmoughHowardStSteel1938; @DestructionDruidHill1947] In 1948, the NAACP sued to try to stop the conversion of Druid Hill Avenue and McCulloh Street into one-way streets but was unsuccessful in reversing the move.[@CourtAskedHalt1948]

The most notable of the proposed road projects in this period was the 1944 plan for an east-west highway prepared by New York planner Robert Moses. The plan would have required the demolition of two hundred city blocks and nineteen hundred residents but Moses was unconcerned, suggesting, "Nothing which we propose to remove will constitute any loss to Baltimore."[@PietilaNotmyneighborhood2010, 219] Moses argued that the demolition of "slums" was a benefit as "the more of them that are wiped out the healthier Baltimore will be in the long run."[@LiebWhitemanlane2011, 56]

### Post-war urban renewal: 1950s–1960s

<!-- From 1954-1968 -->

In 1956, the state selected the Mount Royal area as an urban renewal site for the development of the State Center office complex.

<!-- According to [Indyreader](https://indyreader.org/content/history-housing-policy-and-segregation-baltimore)

> In the period between 1950 and 1964, Baltimore embarked on an aggressive urban renewal program that displaced more than 25,000 people, 85% of them African-American.  In 1953, the City's Redevelopment Commission designated eight areas of the city to be redeveloped, including urban renewal projects in Waverly and the area just west of Johns Hopkins Hospital.  In Waverly, a residential and commercial project that included 290 apartments and 270 parking spaces was designated by the Redevelopment Commission for white occupants only. -->

African American school administrator Francis Wood continued to use build on the changes suggested by the Strayer school survey in the early 1920s. Between 1929 and 1940, Wood increased attendance for black elementary and junior high school students to above 85% and above 90% for black high school students.[@JohnsonStrayersurveycolored2012, 44]<!-- What were White school administrators saying in this period?--> The old State Normal School (1876; Francis Earlougher Davis, architect) located at the northeast corner of N. Carrollton and W. Lafayette Avenues, vacated in 1915 and later converted to school district offices, was converted in 1931 into George Washington Carver Vocational-Technical High School, the first school in Maryland to provide vocational training to Black students.<!-- Revise! Adapted from the digital exhibit.-->

While teacher salaries had been effectively equalized for White and Black teachers in Baltimore City in 1925, other jurisdictions around the state continued to discriminate against Black educators. Between 1936 and 1939, the statewide campaign to address this injustice (led by Black teachers, represented by the Maryland State Colored Teachers Association, the Baltimore branch of the NAACP, and the NAACP national office) became best known and most successful statewide advocacy efforts. The campaign was "an important factor in the resurgence of the freedom movement in the 'border' and southern states of the late 1930s and early 1940s." It was a vindication of of Charles Houston's "strategic vision" of Maryland as a "legal laboratory" where Civil Rights advocates could combine "litigation based on the Fourteenth Amendment with mass mobilization to overturn Jim Crow in the educational sphere."[@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 292-298]

### School desegregation before Brown: 1930s–1950s

Even as Francis Wood, along with many black teachers and families, advocated for improvements to black schools within the segregated system, others fought to end school segregation at every level from elementary schools to universities.

The best known case in this period was [Murray v. Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_v._Pearson) (1935) where Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston won Donald Gaines Murray the right to attend the University of Maryland School of Law. The case was the first major case in the NAACP's broader education campaign.[@SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009, 207-209; @SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 202-206] Later, attorney Charles Hamilton Houston, cited the extensive coverage of the *Murray* case in the *Baltimore Afro-American* as a model of how "court proceedings" can help sway public opinion.[@SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009, 209] The court:

>noted the state's requirement under the Fourteenth Amendment, as it was understood at that time, to provide substantially an equal treatment in the facilities it provides from public funds. Since Maryland chose to only provide one law school for use by students in the state, that law school had to be available to all races.<!-- Citation missing! -->

The win was celebrated at the annual meeting of the national NAACP in Baltimore, in the "midst of presidential election season." The event attracted more than five hundred delegates, including two hundred youth delegates organized by Juanita Jackson, and, according to Patricia Sullivan "offered a venue for delegates to report on developments in their communities to a nationally representative group; develop contacts; debate, refine, and develop strategies and tactics; and see their efforts within the full context of NAACP activity."[@SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009, 223] In a speech at the meeting, [Walter Francis White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Francis_White), referenced the recent victory in the *Murray* case, saying: "If you are willing to struggle with us... who knows but there may be Negroes in the universities of states such as Mississippi and Arkansas?"[@SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009, 223-224]

<!-- NOTE: Skotnes suggests that the victory in the Murray case led to Lillie Carroll Jackson becoming the head of the NAACP, a reorganization, and mass membership campaign. 207-211 -->

The case also led the national NAACP to offer Thurgood Marshall a six month position after a year of working on a fee basis so, in October 1936, Marshall closed his office in Baltimore and moved to New York to start work.[@SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009, 229] Still from New York, Marshall and the NAACP supported changes in Maryland as the NAACP's National Legal Committee campaign against segregated schools and discriminatory education policy led the Maryland General Assembly to pass a law mandating equal school terms for White and Black students in 1937.[@SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009, 231]

<!-- NOTE: Recurring theme of Baltimore leading the country. A test bed for approaches. -->

In the late 1940s, Carl Murphy and Juanita Jackson Mitchell began pushing to desegregate Baltimore public schools and, in 1952, the NAACP and Thurgood Marshall successfully forced the city permit a small group of African American students to enroll at the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute.[@BaumBrownBaltimore2011, 155; @TempletonAdmissionNegroBoys1954; @ThomsenIntegrationBaltimorePolytechnic1983]

<!-- Add information on Universities. -->

In 1947, Dr. Ralph J. Young became the first African American to join teaching staff at Johns Hopkins Hospital and, in 1950, Frederick I. Scott becomes the first African American to graduate from Johns Hopkins University. That same year, Juanita Jackson Mitchell becomes the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Maryland Law School. In 1951, Hiram Whittle became the first black undergraduate to enroll at the University of Maryland and, on August 1, 1952, Polytechnic High School opened to African American students on a limited basis.[@TempletonAdmissionNegroBoys1954] <!-- NOTE: See @seawright_desgregation_1970 on the Donald Murray Case. -->

### School integration after Brown: 1954–1960s

<!-- This section feels disjointed and thin on details. -->

Unlike many other Southern cities and other jurisdictions in Maryland, the Baltimore City School Board, chaired by Walter Sondheim, responded quickly to the 1954 Supreme Court decision in [Brown v. Board of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v.Board_of_Education) by announcing a plan to end legal segregation. The city continued the long-standing policy of "open-enrollment" (where any student could attend any school) but dropped the requirement that Black students attend segregated "colored schools."

After a brief outbreak of unrest at four recently integrated White public schools, representatives of nineteen civic, religious, educational and labor groups came together to form the Coordinating Council for Civic Unity to support the "peaceful opening of schools." The group, composed largely of White organizations, reportedly "served as an information clearing house and 'fire brigade' on the alert for other racial friction."[@ParrisBlacksCityHistory1971, 369]

Standing in contrast to the ["massive resistance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_resistance) seen elsewhere in the South, Baltimore's move won praise at the time, but historian Howard Baum notes the critical flaw in the plan: "Explicitly, [the school board] would not discriminate against black children; implicitly, neither would it act on their behalf."[@BaumBrownBaltimore2011, 155] For White families, the policy likely "added to racial anxiety", as Baum notes:

> Parents could not know what a school's makeup would be when classes started.... This uncertainty not only added to anxiety but also made leaving city public schools a choice with a more predictable outcome."[@BaumBrownBaltimore2011, 172]<!-- Using this quote along seems to privilege the experience of White parents above Black students. -->

![White supremacist leader Bryant Bowles at rally against school desegregation in Baltimore, 1954 October 5.

But within a few years, after 1954, there were two trends in enrollment. The first was the slow growing<!--Word choice?--> but moderate racial integration of city schools. The second was the school district's transition from majority White to a majority Black student enrollment.[@BaumBrownBaltimore2011, 156] By 1960, a majority of students in Baltimore's school district were black. One-third of Black students now attended formerly White schools but many students still attended segregated schools.

In 1963, a group of White and Black parents, known as 28 Parents, presented a report to the school board describing how students continued to experience *de facto* segregation. The activists identified three contributing factors:

- The construction of new schools in racially segregated neighborhoods; making a segregated student population more likely
- The preference for enrolling neighborhood children when schools were "overcrowded"; again reinforcing existing patterns of segregation
- Administrative actions to discourage integration. Baum notes, "Some white principals encouraged white parents to transfer their children out when black enrollment grew. Some principals reject black transfer applications to predominantly white schools."

Even within integrated schools, "ability tracking" separated black and White students within the building. The 28 Parents report highlighted a disturbing reality for Civil Rights activists:

> After a decade of legal segregation, most children attended class with majorities of their own race... By the time the board ended practices that limited choices, the desegregation policy had a ten-year history associated in the public mind with continuing segregation."[@BaumBrownBaltimore2011, 158]<!-- Is this a quote from Baum or from the 28 Parents report? Citation is confusing. -->

Finally, the [1964 Civil Rights Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Civil_Rights_Act) created a federal interest in desegregating schools encouraging the city to take further action.

## Public accommodations

### Public parks and recreational facilities: 1930s–1950s

The 1930s and 1940s also saw legal and activist efforts to desegregation Baltimore's public parks and recreational facilities. Baltimore's growing Black population and their demands for recreational facilities made it more difficult in the 1930s for Baltimore City to maintain segregation.[@KirschMunicipalGolfCivil2007; @WellsSeparateEqualDesegregating2008; @BaidyaroyBlacksGolfEmerging2011] For example, in September 1934, the Carroll Park golf course partly opened to Black golfers but limited them to specific days to keep them segregated from White golfers. In 1938, two black golfers, Dallas Nicholas and William I. Gosnell, sued Baltimore City to try to overturn this policy but were unsuccessful.[@WellsSeparateEqualDesegregating2008] <!-- TODO: Find more details about this suit. --><!-- Citation missing page number. -->

On December 17, 1947, a group of White and Black young people organized an integrated youth basketball game at Garrison Junior High School to protest segregationist policies. This pattern of interracial protest continued on July 11, 1948 when a group of young Black and White tennis players organized a game on the tennis courts at Druid Hill Park. The protest led to a lawsuit against the city, *Boyer v. Garrett* (1949), that resulted in the court overturning the city's long-standing policy of racial segregation in city parks.[@ChesnutBoyerGarrett1949]

The 1953 accidental death of a Black boy swimming with friends in the Patapsco River pushed the Baltimore NAACP to request and, ultimately file suit, to force the desegregation of Baltimore's public swimming pools. The newly desegregated pools opened on June 23, 1956 and the city closed the only public pool for Black swimmers, [Pool No. 2](https://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/500) located in Druid Hill Park the next year.[@WiltseContestedWatersSocial2009, 154-157]

In 1950, a group of Black activists attempted to purchase tickets for the beach at [Fort Smallwood Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Smallwood_Park), a popular recreational park located in Anne Arundel County but owned and managed by Baltimore City.<!-- Who participated in this protest? Who organized it? What happened when they tried to buy tickets? --> When the park refused to sell the Black visitors tickets, they sued the city. At the same time, the 1954 *Brown* decision pushed these issues to the forefront of the local debate and gave . The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of the activists and linked the *Brown* decision to the necessity of integrating of public facilities, writing:

> it is obvious that racial segregation in recreational activities can no longer be sustained as a proper exercise of the police power of the State; for if that power cannot be invoked to sustain racial segregation in the schools, where attendance is compulsory...it cannot be sustained with respect to public beach and bathhouse facilities, the use of which is entirely optional.[@Schustercityswingset2011, 114]

By 1955, advocate's<!-- I think it was the local NAACP but I need to double-check. --> legal case against the city had arrived at the U.S. Supreme Court resulting in a decision in *[Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City v. Dawson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_and_City_Council_of_Baltimore_v._Dawson)* that forced the end of segregation at state pools and beaches in 1955.

### Theaters, department stores, & restaurants: 1938–1960s

In many American cities, including Baltimore, downtown department stores had special significance as "some of Baltimore's most prominent sites of civic culture and modernity," but many downtown department stores refused to allow Black shoppers to try on clothes, return clothes after a purchase, or provide service to Black shoppers at all. In addition, store restaurants and lunch counters refused to seat Black diners. The combination of the prominence and prejudice made these stores a key target for anti-racist protests from the late 1930s through the 1960s.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003]<!-- Missing page number --> Between 1938 and 1940, the Baltimore Urban League and NAACP joined in private negotiations with downtown department store owners seeking to end their discriminatory policies against Black shoppers.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 43] Local Black activists met again with a representative of the Retail Merchants Association<!-- What is this? --> in February 1943 but no changes followed.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 48] In 1945, the *Afro-American* newspaper began the "Orchids and Onions" campaign to celebrate stores that did not discrimination against black shopper ("Orchids") and shame downtown department stores with discriminatory policies ("Onions").[@FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998, 183-184]

Black people faced similar policies of separation and discrimination at local theaters as well as stores. In addition, theaters often refused to book black musicians and performers. On February 1, 1948, for example, the Baltimore police arrested a group of Morgan State College students for picketing Ford's Theatre on Fayette Street. The students and other activists soon returned and continued a five year campaign to end segregated seating at Ford's Theatre. Finally, in 1953, Ford's Theatre ended segregated seating. After the Lyric Theatre on Mt. Royal Avenue refused to allow singer and activist Marian Anderson to perform, Baltimore's Commission on Human Relations<!-- When was the Commission created? This is the first mention. --> intervened and persuaded the theatre owners to allow Marian Anderson to appear in January 1954. Despite this progress, however, most hotels and restaurants remained segregated so, after the performance, Sidney Hollander, Sr. hosted an afternoon reception with Anderson at his home. <!-- TODO: Where did Sidney Hollander, Sr. live? Bolton Hill or Windsor Hills? Explain who Hollander was. -->

<!-- Public accommodations section from 1954-1968 -->The discrimination African Americans faced in public accommodations was not just one of simple exclusion. Historian Paul A. Kramer notes that the discriminatory "racial practices" at Baltimore's downtown department stores included three main aspects:

1. Discrimination in employment (stores only hired Black people as maintenance or stockroom workers, elevator operators, porters, and restroom attendants; not any higher-paying, higher-status jobs)
2. Refusal to serve Black customers at lunch counters
3. Policies prohibiting Black customers from trying on or returning clothing

The prohibition on returns from Black customers (known as the "final sale" policy) reveals one of the fundamental motivation behind racial segregation: "anxieties and fears about physical contact between whites and blacks." Kramer continues:

> For most whites, blacks represented sources of unspecified physical and moral pollution ... Black and white bodies might "touch" in the exchange of forks and plates at store lunch-counters. Even more threatening to whites was the possibility that the clothes they tried on or purchased might bear an invisible taint of black physical contact.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 41]

Notably, in early 1943, when the Baltimore NAACP sought to overturn the state's Jim Crow laws, the repeal bill they supported was sent to state legislature *Hygiene Committee* rather than *Judiciary Committee* for consideration.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 42]

One early challenge to these segregationist policies came in 1953 with an interracial group of CORE activists using sit-ins to protest segregated lunch counters (a strategy used previously in New York City in 1939 and by other CORE activists in Chicago in 1942). The success of their efforts was noted in the regular column of Mrs. B.M. Phillips (“If You Ask Me”) in the *Afro-American* on November 7, 1953:

> Thanks to the Committee On Racial Equality, (CORE), the Urban league, and the Americans for Democratic Action, (ADA), more stores in the 200 block W. Lexington st. are realizing there is no color line in the dollars you spend. Lunch counters and restaurants in the Kresge and Woolworth Five and Ten have been serving all customers for several weeks. McCrory's has just reversed its policy and will serve all comers […] Schulte United in the 200 block Lexington is still acting silly.[@PhillipsIfYouAsk1953]

The success, however, was limited. One 1955 survey found that 91% of 191 randomly-selected Baltimore businesses reported either the "exclusion" or "segregation" of blacks.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 38] The annual report of the Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations also provided updates on discriminatory policies listing "places of public accommodations [that] are open to all" in March 1958.<!--   Revise this section to address the role and history of the Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations and the Commission on Human Relations. It may make sense to move this section to the introduction. -->

As Phillips alludes in her column, the issue of public accommodation was often presented in terms of consumer politics. This made the issue personal for middle-class black activists like Mrs. Madeline W. Murphy who wrote to the Vice President of Hoschild Kohn in 1956 to say "not only [do I] feel equal to the average Hochschild Kohn's consumers but I feel superior to them." Such emphasis on racial equality as individual access made the desegregation of public accommodations "less of a challenge to traditional notions of racial equality" (in contrast to education, employment, and voting rights) and helped secure the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.[@SalvatoreCivilRightsAmerica2004, 82]

CORE's downtown campaign faded after the successful desegregation of the Read's Drug Store lunch counter in January 1955. A new movement of students took up the cause on March 26, 1960 when black student activists from Morgan State University attempted to purchase food at department store restaurants at the Northwood Shopping Center and downtown. The student's tried to purchase lunch at several<!-- There are four stores but only three are listed here. What are the four? Insert address information. --> downtown department stores. They succeeded at Hochschild Kohn; Stewart's shut their food counters to all customers, White and Black; Hutzler's refused to serve a group of twenty students who waited for three hours before leaving.

The sit-ins continued through April 17, 1960, Easter Sunday when the *Sun* reported that Albert D. Hutzler met with Furman Templeton from the Baltimore Urban League, along with activists David Glenn and Robert B. Watts. After the meeting, Hutzler announced: "We have lifted restrictions. Negroes will be served in our restaurants." Hecht-May and other downtown stores followed Hoschild Kohn and Hutzler's with the change.

A large collection of letters sent to Hoschild Kohn after their policy change in late March 1960 reflect attitudes to desegregation in the period. Interestingly, there are ten times the number of letters in support of integration, likely because activists recognized both the important of integration and the fact that the change remained "frighteningly reversible." Some opponents of desegregation described a rationale of "consumer choice," as one woman wrote:

> Do you realize that by so doing [integrating], you are taking from the White Race any choice they had of segregation or integration when dining outside of their homes?[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 54]

Others threatened to stay away from the downtown store, now that the policy of segregation had been abandoned. These threats reflected the racialized geography of the Baltimore metropolitan region as segregated White suburbs quickly expanded after World War II. Historian Paul Kramer notes:

> more than one of the racist critics wrote as self-conscious suburbanites, warning the downtown that integration would further provoke the flight of white residences and businesses. In the process, they revealed the extent to which the suburbs were imagined as racial islands still free of black "invasion": downtown segregation was the only remaining draw that could pull whites in from their comfortable, newly-designed racial enclaves.[@KramerWhiteSalesRacial2003, 55]<!-- Trim or integrate this block quote. -->

Notably, department stores had their own role in the suburban exodus with the first suburban location for [Hutzler's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutzler%27s) established in Towson in 1952. They quickly continued their suburban expansion with new stores at [Eastpoint Mall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastpoint_Mall) (1956) in Dundalk and [Westview Mall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westview_Mall) (1958) near Catonsville. [Hoschild Kohn's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hochschild_Kohn%27s) expanded within the city including a new location at the Edmondson Village Shopping Center at the city's western edge in 1947 and in a [modern new store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hochschild,_Kohn_Belvedere_and_Hess_Shoes) at York Road and Belvedere Avenue in 1948. Hoschild Kohn's later suburban growth included Harundale Mall (1958), The Mall in Columbia (1971), Security Square Mall (1972) in Woodlawn.<!-- See Wikipedia articles for the individual malls and the store page. -->

Black Baltimoreans also saw the importance role of suburbanization in reshaping the debate over segregated public accommodations in downtown Baltimore. For example, in August 1957, the *Afro* newspaper's "If You Ask Me" columnist Elizabeth Murphy Phillips, remarked:

> The big downtown stores and business have not welcomed colored people in the past... Their white only customers have moved to the suburbs and the colored customers they spurned are moving out too. So the heart of the city is no longer Lexington and Howard Sts.[@PhillipsIfYouAsk1957; @OBrienElizabethMurphyMoss1998; Elizabeth Murphy (1917-1998) was known as Elizabeth Murphy Moss after the death of her husband Frank W. Phillips, Jr. in 1962 and her marriage to Alonzo Paul Moss in 1963. During her long career at the*Afro* newspaper, she worked as a reporter, editor and publisher and served on the Baltimore school board in the 1960s.] <!-- FIXME: Double-check the citation above -->

Around the United States, the push for public accommodations continued to secure victories around state policies.  Eighteen states already had such laws but in the 1950s states including Oregon (1953), Montana (1955), New Mexico (1955), Vermont (1957), Maine (1957), Idaho (1959), Alaska (1959), and, in 1961, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming all enacted legislation prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations. In 1962, Baltimore joined several other cities that enacted public accommodations laws in this period including Wilmington, Delaware; Saint Louis and Kansas City, Missouri; and El Paso, Texas. [@SalvatoreCivilRightsAmerica2004, 50; @ThompsonCivilRightsVanguard1996, 373] Maryland finally followed with a new state law in January 1963.[@SalvatoreCivilRightsAmerica2004, 64]

In late February 1964, the NAACP supported the Baltimore City Public Accommodations and Fair Employment Practice Ordinances which "guaranteed an end to lawful discrimination in 'employment practices, educational institutions, places of public accommodation, resort or amusement, and health and welfare agencies.'"[@ShoemakerWeShallOvercome1994, 265]<!-- NOTE: It is unclear if this is different legislation than the 1962 law (or if the 1962 date referenced in Thompson is an error). -->

## Employment

In 1949, the Baltimore City Medical Society, a local professional association for doctors, voted to admit African American members.

From July 14 to July 16 1961, members of the Student Non-Violence Coordinating Committee (including representatives from all sixteen Southern states and Washington, D.C.) met at the Prince Hall Masonic Temple to begin planning a campaign "to persuade utility companies in the South to discontinue discrimination in employment."[@NEGROESSEEUTILITIES1961] In Baltimore, student members of the local NAACP chapter organized pickets at the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company and the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company<!-- Where exactly? --> to call for equitable hiring of African Americans.[@NEGROSTUDENTSPICKET1961]<!-- I'm inferring from the context here. -->

<!-- Example of cultural workers. Does this belong here? -->

Another example is the Arena Playhouse at 801 McCulloh Street occupied by the Arena Players, an African American theatre troupe, since 1962. Established in 1953 as an outgrowth of the "The Negro Little Theater", the Arena Players spent a decade performing at varied locations including Coppin State University, the Druid Hill YMCA, the Great Hall Theater of St. Mary's Church in Walbrook, and the Carl J. Murphy Auditorium at Morgan State University. After securing a long-term performance space, the Arena Players acquired the building in 1969 and through the 1970s continued to serve "as one of the only venues dedicated to showcasing the works of black playwrights and performers."[@ArenaPlayersIncorporatedHistoryArenaPlayers]

Three major themes:

- Public relief for black workers and families
- Organizing industrial black workers
- Public employment for black workers

### Public relief for Black families: 1930s

<!-- Needs an introduction talking about the role of public relief as a Civil Rights issue. Double-check that this period doesn't run into the early history of the welfare rights movement. Add in context on the national history of relief, welfare, and welfare rights. -->

![African American women and children receiving aid from the Baltimore Emergency Relief Commission photographed at home in their kitchen, 1934. Courtesy [Enoch Pratt Free Library, Enoch Barker Collection, Digital Maryland, mdaa152](http://collections.digitalmaryland.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/mdaa/id/195/rec/1030). ]({{ "/assets/images/mdaa152.jpeg" | absolute_url }})

"The *Afro* regularly exposed racial discrimination in the relief system and publicized the actions of those who fought it. … It reported on the activities of predominantly Black unions such as ILA Local 858 and on integrated unions such as the MWIU and the ACW, and it approvingly covered the interracial activities of labor radicals and industrial unionists." [@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 185]

Baltimore Urban League and Edward Lewis was "integrally involved in launching the PUL in 1933… also largely responsible for the BUL-ACW meetings for Black garment workers in early 1933 and the creation of the Negro Labor Committee." [@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 185-186] 

Early on the People's Unemployment League, "called for financial relief and medical care for the unemployed, large-scale public works projects, massive construction of low-cost housing, unemployment insurance, public employment bureaus, and a mandatory thirty-hour maximum work week."[@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 97-112]<!-- Quote is from p. 99. --> 

While the federal government’s New Deal programs brought some relief, discrimination persisted even in the administration of these programs. The *Afro-American* reported that a Black household with eight people received \$8.94 a week for food but a White household of the same size received $12.70.[@FarrarBaltimoreAfroAmerican189219501998, 92-98]

 In 1934, the Family Welfare Association found that 13% of White residents and 40% of Black residents were on relief.<!-- Completely duplicative with the passage below. --> Historian Roderick Ryon reported how a study by the Urban League and an "association of the unemployed" looked at "150 white and black relief cases in the same year and discovered that black families typically received smaller relief sums and were removed from relief rosters before whites."[@RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980, 19]

 <!-- TODO: I read something related to the Urban League that referenced the depression beginning for black people in Baltimore around 1926. I'm sure that would be a pattern found in other cities if it is accurate. --><!-- More on unemployment/job loss during the Depression? Overall figures on poverty? Look for more information in Skontes (2012) and Argersinger (2017). -->

### Organizing Black industrial workers: 1930s–1940s

<!-- Missing transition! Look for information from the initial Urban League report on discrimination by local industry. -->

In the 1930s, Black activists put growing pressure on public and private employers to end segregated hiring and begin offering more opportunities to Black workers. This pressure included both a renewed legal efforts backed by the NAACP at the local and national level and a series of grass-roots protest actions organized by activist groups like CORE, inter-religious coalitions like the Baltimore Council of Churches, and by students (especially from Morgan State College). At the national level, the 1935 passage of the [National Labor Relations Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act_of_1935) created new avenues for organizing and protest but still excluded many Black workers through exemptions for railroad, agricultural, and domestic workers.

Through the 1940s, White unions affiliated with the [American Federation of Labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor) continued to exclude black workers. A major change took place in 1939, when Edward Lewis with the Baltimore Urban League organized an "independent group of Black construction workers," known as the Building Trades Association (BTA), sought to integrate the segregated White construction works' locals. Despite stuff resistance, the group succeeded in their push for the integration of the Bricklayers Union working on the Poe housing project in 1939. By January 1941, thanks to further organizing and advocacy, one hundred and ten Black carpenters, all members of Local 544 of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, had found work on government projects.[@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 263-265]

<!-- TODO: What proportion of black workers were employed in the service sector? How did employment opportunities vary by gender? Could this be a good place to talk about employment for blind or deaf workers? Or about black entrepreneurship? --><!-- Look for information about AFL and CIO union membership in Baltimore -->

<!-- TODO: There must have been more going on for black workers in this period than just the CIO. I think small business ownership should also be incorporated into this section. -->

Cumberbatch also argues that by working "with both the Fair Employment Practices Committee and the CIO, civil rights leaders were able to break through racial barriers that had historically confined African Americans to the least paying and least desirable jobs."[@CumberbatchWorkingracetransformation2001]

Historian Roderick Ryon notes:

>Numbering 144,000 in a population of 817,000 in 1930, city blacks faced greater and different kinds of problems than whites. Substantial numbers were employed in 1930, but they occupied the lowest rung of the wage ladder. Indeed low wages for adult males had forced thousands of women, adolescents and the elderly on the job market to supplement meager family incomes. Eighty- five per cent of employable black males held jobs in 1930 compared to 77 percent of native whites, and 51 per cent of employable black women were wage earners, compared to 27 per cent of native whites.[@RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980, 19]

>Thus, the low-paying domestic service offered some 26,000 jobs to Baltimore blacks in 1930, but as conditions worsened, hundreds of white employers, determined to "take care of their own" first, preferred whites over blacks. As some city industries began to recover they employed whites rather than rehire blacks, and by 1936, seventeen percent of Baltimore's employable, skilled black males were out of work.[@RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980, 19]

>Conducting a survey of 115 retail and manufacturing firms in 1933, the Urban League discovered that blacks constituted 8.3 per cent of the firm's employees in 1933, compared to 9.2 per cent in 1930[@RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980, 19]<!-- Break up these giant block quotes. -->

However, local unions, often, did little to help black Baltimoreans, as Ryon observed:

>In 1931 black longshore-men walked out of a meeting of the City Federation of Labor rather than accept Jim Crow seating. Local white unions occasionally violated or evaded even sacred commandments of labor. When black brick layers arrived in the city, union cards in hand, they were offered free train fare out of the city, not the traditional welcome of newcomers. Rather than work with black union hod-carriers, whites in the AF of L bricklayers' union used white scab labor.[@RyonAmbiguousLegacyBaltimore1980, 20]

Another important supporter of reform were black professional organizations such as the Progressive Engineers Association of Maryland (organized in 1938) and the MeDeSo (a club for black physicians and dentists established by Dr. J.E.T. Camper and others in 1942).<!-- Is this the right place for this information? Should there be a separate section on professional trades? -->

In 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 which established Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) and lay a foundation for broader activism against discriminatory hiring.[@SkotnesNewDealAll2012, 315]<!-- Better citation needed. -->

Such efforts were frustrated, however, by the weak support of many industrial unions for black workers and the racism of white workers. This challenge is exemplified in the example of Bethlehem Steel in 1943<!-- Check date! --> when white workers walked off the job in protest over the hiring of black workers.

Frustrations like this led Charles Hamilton Houston to resign from the FEPC on December 3, 1945 in a letter to President Truman and to hold a press conference exposing "Truman's obstruction of the committee's mandate and to mobilize pressure on the administration." The FEPC ultimately expired six months later after being "starved of funds."[@SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009, 310-311] Clarence Mitchell, still at the FEPC, praised Houston and the "National Council for a Permanent FEPC" saying without Houston's advocacy "the agency would have been put to sleep with the issuance of some dry reports." Mitchell said the "lesson to be learned" is that "minorities should never exchange immediate possibilities for real progress... for promises of future action," and "those who profess "liberal convictions" must be watched to make sure "the spoken word will be followed by concrete action." After FEPC closed, Michell joined the NAACP's Washington bureau as head of the new Department of Labor, fighting for legislation to support an equal employment agenda.[@SullivanLiftEveryVoice2009, 311]

<!-- How did this continue to change in the 1950s and 1960s? -->Increasing opportunity for industrial workers remained a major concern for the National Urban League. In the 1950s, the League established new connections to the Prince Hall Masons whose Supreme Council underwrote "demonstration vocational guidance institutes" in Baltimore, as well as Birmingham, St. Louis, and Pittsburgh.[@ParrisBlacksCityHistory1971, 358]

### Opening public jobs to Black workers: 1940s–1960s

An early sign of progress came in July 1937 when the Baltimore Police Department hired Violet Hill Whyte as the city's first black police officer. Whyte, however, was not a uniform officer and did not carry a gun as part of her work.

Public workers had more success in the years after World War II than some private workers. In 1945, the NAACP won a critical legal victory to end a segregated training program at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in the case of Kerr v. Enoch Pratt Free Library (1945).[@JacksonDiscriminationdeferredHow2008; @HerzogKerrPrincipleState2007] In 1953, the Baltimore City Fire Department appointed their first African American firemen.

In 1953, the Baltimore City Fire Department appointed the city's first Black firemen.

In 1956, the city enacted an Equal Employment Ordinance.<!--This section needs additional context.-->

<!-- One example of a building that was built after *Brown* but reflects this same logic of a "separate but equal" facility is the Melvin Cade National Guard Armory where the state decided to maintain a segregated black National Guard unit and, in 1960, erected a new building for the unit at 2620 Winchester Street. The new building became a civic and social center for African American residents in West Baltimore, hosting dance parties, lectures, and neighborhood meetings throughout the 1960s and 1970s. After the death of Melvin H. Cade, commanding officer of the 229th Battalion of the Maryland National Guard, in 1964, the Guard renamed the building in his honor. Baltimore City listed the Armory as a local landmark in 2009. -->

## Courts, prisons, and criminal injustice: 1930s–1960s

### Anti-lynching activism and police violence: 1930s–1940s

<!-- TODO: This section is a bit of a mess right now. I'm not sure how to distinguish this from the prior 1905-1929 period except by the emphasis on the Euel Lee case and the 1942 March on Annapolis. Maybe that is enough? -->

Lynching and criminal injustice was at the center of black organizing and advocacy around Civil Rights and racial injustice in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Such cases highlighted the important role of the Communist Party in supporting African American Civil Rights as a strategy for build supporting among African Americans broadly.

On December 4, 1931, [Matthew Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Williams_(laborer)) was lynched at Salisbury, Maryland—as the Maryland Historical Society [underbelly blog](http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2012/11/29/an-american-tragedy/) notes:

> On December 4, 1931, Matthew Williams, an African American man, shot and killed his white employer in Salisbury and then turned the gun on himself in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. That evening, a mob of more than a thousand dragged Williams from his hospital bed where he lay critically wounded, and hung him up on the courthouse lawn. His body was then dragged to the town’s African American business district, and set on fire.  The Williams murder was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882, and the first since 1911.<!-- Break this up and paraphrase.-->

On October 14, 1931, Euel Lee, known as "Orphan Jones", was arrested for the murder of a white family reportedly over a disagreement about wages. The Maryland Communist Party took Lee’s case and lawyer [Bernard Ades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Ades) successfully moved Lee’s trial to Towson in Baltimore County. Ultimately, Ades lost the case (Lee was executed on October 28, 1933) but in the process helped to combat the informal prohibition on black jurors in Baltimore County.<!-- Citation missing! -->

<!-- Insert missing transition. -->Two years later, on October 18, 1935:

> a mob of a thousand or more people stormed into the Princess Anne jail house and hauled Armwood from his cell down to the street below. Before he was hung from a tree some distance away, Armwood was dragged through the streets, beaten, stabbed, and had one ear hacked off.  Armwood’s lifeless body was then paraded through the town, finally ending up near the town’s courthouse, where the mob doused the corpse with gasoline and set it on fire.<!-- Citation missing! --><!-- Break this up and paraphrase.-->

### Inequitable sentencing and treatment: 1930s–1960s

One major area of concern for the Baltimore NAACP throughout this period was inequitable sentencing for Black and white criminal defendants. The most outrageous cases were the frequent incidence of light to nonexistent sentences for white people who raped or committed acts of sexualized violence against Black women and girls. For example, one 1937 Baltimore NAACP branch report, noted:

> There have been a number of cases of White men attacking Colored girls, and light sentences being imposed. We feel that Negro womanhood should be protected, and will do all we can to put a stop to this most brutal crime.[@SartainBordersEqualityNAACP2013, 50]

Historian Danielle L. McGuire persuasively argues for the importance of reinterpreting the history of the civil rights movement with an understanding of "the role rape and sexual violence played in African Americans' daily lives and within the larger freedom struggle."[@McGuireDarkEndStreet2011, xx] McGuire points to the 1944 kidnapping and rape of [Recy Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recy_Taylor) in Abbeville, Alabama as a critical event. After the gross injustice of a local grand jury failing to indict her white assailants, Black supporters from around the country rallied to push for a new investigation but a subsequent second grand jury still failed to bring charges. This collective resistance slowly began to build towards changes in Maryland and across the south. For example, in Bel Air, Harford County on March 31, 1947, Judge Frederick L. Cobourn sentenced Charles Reeder, a thirty-five-year-old white man, to life in prison for the rape of Mary Lance, a Black woman married to a local tenants farmer who was pregnant at the time of the assault. Lance and her husband had enlisted assistance from the Baltimore NAACP who recruited attorney Calvin Douglass to assisted the state in the protection and winning the state's first ever conviction  the first time in the history of Maryland that a white man was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape of a Black woman.^[@SartainBordersEqualityNAACP2013, 63; @PrecedentSetHuckster1947; Lance and her husband, along with their children, moved to Baltimore after the assault.]

Over a decade later, the 1959 testimony of [Betty Jean Owens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Jean_Owens) in the trial of four white men, who kidnapped and raped her, "focused national attention on the sexual exploitation" of Black women and led to rape convictions for white men in Montgomery, Alabama, Raleigh, North Carolina; and Burton South Carolina.[@McGuireDarkEndStreet2011, xx-xi] McGuire suggests that the 1965 conviction of Norman Cannon, a white man who abducted and raped a Black teenager, in Mississippi "ought to be considered one of the bookends of the modern civil rights movement."[@McGuireDarkEndStreet2011, xxi]

Conditions in confinement were another area of regular concern and the subject of persistent reform movements before and after World War II. In the early 1920s, John Pyles, the white director of Cheltenham reformatory, was accused of failing to provide adequate medical facilities, beating the resident boys for talking during dinner, and even clubbing boys  on the head. The Black boys at Cheltenham were "not even delinquents but orphans" and "were being 'farmed out' to businesses and farms as cheap labor." While Pyles was removed from his role as director in 1925, the selection of a new site for reformatory and other long sought improvements not didn't arrive until 1945.<!-- Check date. -->

The entire board of the Cheltenham School for Boys resigned amid criticisms that the facility for young Black men operated as a penal work farm instead of a training school. <!-- Check reasoning and interpretation.

Allen, president of Southern Life Insurance Company and Grand Worshipful Master of the Free and Accepted Masons and police officer Violet Hill Whyte).^[The [William Preston Lane papers](https://digital.lib.umd.edu/archivesum/actions.DisplayEADDoc.do?source=MdU.ead.histms.0095.xml) at located at the University of Maryland. The Maryland Historical Society Collections include a [photograph of Lane](http://www.mdhs.org/digitalimage/board-members-cheltenham-school-boys) with the new board of the Cheltenham School in 1951. Located in Prince George's County, the Cheltenham School for Boys incorporated in 1870 as the House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children and, by the 1950s, was known as the Boys' Village of Maryland.] <!--What is the significance of the board resignation and new appointments?--> Ultimately, Maryland integrated the state's juvenile correctional institutions in 1961 following successful litigation by the Baltimore NAACP.[@SartainBordersEqualityNAACP2013, 62]
