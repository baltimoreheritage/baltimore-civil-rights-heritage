## Introduction

From 1954 to 1968, the residents of Baltimore experienced a dramatic transformation with major changes to local, state and national policies on Civil Rights. Between 1950 and 1953, Civil Rights activists won a series of small but promising victories: the integration of trains and boats by the state legislature and the end of segregated seating at Ford's Theatre and a few downtown lunch counters. Even greater dramatic changes followed the 1954 Supreme Court decision in _Brown v. Board of Education_.[@baum_brown_2011] The decision, argued before the court by Thurgood Marshall, led the city to end the legal separation of Baltimore's public schools between white and colored. The decision also empowered local activists, buoyed by rising expectations after World War II, to expand their fight for integrated public accommodations, open housing, and political power.

 In the 1950s and 1960s, activists succeeded in pushing Civil Rights to the forefront of public discussion on civic issues. In 1955, the *Baltimore Sun* started to turn away from a legacy of racist reporting to publish "The City We Live In": a series of articles highlighting the injustice facing black Baltimoreans. As Governor (1951-1959) and Mayor (1943-1947 and 1963-1967), Theodore McKeldin reflected the broader response by liberal elected officials and residents who met the persistent demands of the Civil Rights movement with incremental change; ending segregation policies at state parks in 1953; at public pools and beaches in 1955; and supporting the Baltimore City Equal Employment Ordinance in 1956.

Just as the 1960 [Greensboro sit-ins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro_sit-ins) demonstrate the changing nature of the Civil Rights movement at the national level, the expanding scope of the fight for Civil Rights is illustrated in Baltimore by earlier efforts to desegregate downtown lunch counters and department stores. Beginning in 1953 and continuing in 1954 and 1955, white and black activists with the Baltimore chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) began to hold sit-in protests at "five-and-dime" lunch counters on Lexington Street. In 1960, activists pushed for desegregation at larger downtown department stores and restaurants on Howard Street including Hutzler's, Stewart's, and Hoschild-Kohn's. Students from Morgan State College and other area schools (organized as the Civic Interest Group) played an essential part in 1955 and in 1960—an indicator of the growing importance of the student movement.[@kramer_white_2003; @meier_successful_1989; @palumbos_student_1999]

The gathering momentum and urgency of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore and around the country helped secure federal policy changes with the [Civil Rights Act of 1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957) and the [Civil Rights Act of 1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1960). The 1957 legislation, signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, was the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction, created the [U.S. Commission on Civil Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Commission_on_Civil_Rights). The Commission—though initially limited to fact-finding—played a key role in  documenting injustice. Congress granted the Commission expanded authority under the 1964 Civil Rights legislation. African American women, who experienced the double burden of both racial and gender discrimination (what activists and scholar Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw termed intersectionality), could see progress with the [Equal Pay Act of 1963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Pay_Act_of_1963) and new protections against gender discrimination included with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Baltimore's proximity to Washington, D.C. often tied local activist efforts to a broader federal and national agenda. In 1961, after embarrassing incidents of discrimination against African diplomats at restaurants along U.S. Route 40 in Maryland and Delaware, CORE activists saw an opportunity to push for broader change. CORE recruited volunteers from Baltimore's Civic Interest Group (CIG) and several other organizations for the "Route 40 Project" to challenge the segregated facilities in a massive Freedom Ride on November 11. Just days before the ride began, however, forty-seven restaurants along Route 40 agreed to desegregate thanks to the activists and pressure from the Kennedy administration. CORE called off the ride but sent the volunteers gathering at Howard University to Baltimore instead where they picketed to protest the city's segregated restraurants.[@banks_cores_2011; @erdman_eyes_2007]

The national significance of Baltimore's movement is evident again in 1963, when black church leaders, business owners, and Civil Rights activists worked to recruit and transport thousands of Baltimore residents to Washington, D.C. for the [March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom). In 1966, CORE's announcement of the "Baltimore Target City Project" attracted national media attention. Although the project failed to deliver on CORE's ambitious announcement, the nation's focus on inequality in Baltimore pushed McKeldin to establish the Mayor's Task Force for Civil Rights (also known as the Baltimore Community Relations Commission) focused on taking action on housing, public accommodations, employment, health and welfare, police-community relations, and education.[@mckeldin_state_1966]

In parallel to these efforts to build black power at the national level, other residents focused on building political power for African Americans at the local level. The Colored Women's Democratic Club organized by Victorine Q. Adams in 1946 and regular voter registration campaigns by the NAACP in the 1940s, led directly to the election of [Harry A. Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_A._Cole) to the Maryland State Senate in 1954 and [Verda Welcome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verda_Welcome) in 1962. Cole was first African American ever elected to the Maryland Senate and Welcome was the first black woman to be elected to any state senate in the country—key victories for African Americans seeking change through representation in local and state government. However, these victories also reflected a city where African Americans made up a growing share of the electorate as white residents fled to the suburbs.

In 1954, many local leaders and activists celebrated the Baltimore school board, chaired Walter Sondheim, for their quick response to *Brown*. The city continued the long-standing policy of "open-enrollement" (any student could attend any school) but dropped the requirement that black students attend segregated "colored schools". Although it won praise at the time, historian Howard Baum notes the critical flaw in the plan: "Explicitly, [the school board] would not discriminate against black children; implicitly, neither would it act on their behalf."[@baum_how_2011, 155] For white families, the policy likely "added to racial anxiety", as Baum notes:

> Parents could not know what a school's makeup would be when classes started.... This uncertainty not only added to anxiety but also made leaving city public schools a choice with a more predictable outcome."[@baum_how_2011, 172]

By 1960, a majority of students in Baltimore's school district were black and many students still attended segregated schools. One-third of black students now attended formerly white schools. And although Baltimore's approach to school desegregation avoided the racist reaction of ["massive resistance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_resistance), in 1958, the Maryland State Commission on Interracial Problems observed that the problem "is not with violence but with the frigid withdrawal" of white residents from their black neighbors.[@orser_blockbusting_1994, 133-136]

While some white Baltimoreans sought to promote integrated neighborhoods through groups like Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. (founded in 1959 by James Rouse, Ellsworth Rosen, and Sidney Hollander, Jr.), many more relocated to the still-segregated white communities in the suburbs. Between 1950 and 1960, the population of Baltimore County grew by over 80% (from 270,273 to 492,428). In the same ten year period, Baltimore City lost population (dropping from 949,708  to 939,024) while the proportion of African American residents grew (23.70% to 34.67%). Between 1960 and 1970, the population of Baltimore County continue to grow (26.12% to 621,077). Between 1950 and 1970, the population of Anne Arunel County, the population grew by more than 250% (117,392 in 1950 to 206,634 in 1960 to 297,539 in 1970).

*Table: Bump chart illustrating the changing proportion of the Baltimore MSA population by county.*

![Bump chart illustrating the changing proportion of the Baltimore MSA population by county.](https://baltimoreheritage.github.io/civil-rights-heritage/assets/images/baltimore-population-msa-normalized-1950-1980.png)

The movement of white Baltimoreans to the suburbs relied on federally-subsidized home mortgages (that African Americans could not get) and new highways for cars (that a smaller number of African Americans could afford to purchase). City leaders largely supported the transformation of the roads to accomodate suburban growth through the development of the Jones Falls Expressway (I-83), the planning of the Franklin-Mulberry Expressway, and the Baltimore Beltway (I-695) which opened in stages between 1955 and 1962.

Scholar Harold McDougall described how the federal and local policies supported the development of segregated suburbs in Baltimore and Anne Arundel Counties, writing:

> Exclusionary zoning, though couched in terms of income rather than race, had the practical effect of reinforcing existing divisions along racial lines simply because if you were blacks could afford the suburban housing made more expensive by such regulations.[@mcdougall_black_1993, 49]

Racialized suburban growth, or "white flight", functioned as an implicit strategy of white resistance to integration. White resistance also included more explicit and, at times, violent responses by white people who sought to maintain the status quo and supported elected  officials who ran on their opposition to the Civil Rights movement. White Baltimoreans in the city and suburbs voted in support of [George C. Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace) (the segregationist Democratic Governor of Alabama) in the 1964 Democratic primary and for Barry Goldwater (a Republican Senator and opponent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) in that year's general election. Hundreds of white residents attended segregationist rallies organized by the [National States' Rights Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_States%27_Rights_Party) in Patterson Park or Riverside Park in 1966.

In 1966, perennial candidate [George P. Mahoney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P._Mahoney) won an upset victory in the Democratic primary for Governor (receiving around 30% of the vote). In the general election, Mahoney based his campaign on his opposition to open housing with the slogan "Your home is your castle; protect it."[@hardesty_veil_2009; @hardesty_vodoo_2008] The controversy surrounding Mahoney's racist campaign led a third independent candidate to enter the race which ended with the election of Spiro Agnew. Mahoney may have lost the election but his significant support in the Baltimore region illustrates the scale of white opposition to desegregation in this period.

The election year marked twelve years after the *Brown* decision and twenty-four years after the consequential March on Annapolis. Despite decades of unprecedented activism that overturned most of Maryland's Jim and Jane Crow policies, African Americans in Baltimore continued to struggle against white resistance and racist policies, against employment discrimination, segregated and inadequate housing, unequal educational opportunities, and racist policing. The contradiction between the success of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore and Maryland with the continued challenges facing Baltimore's black residents again drew the attention of national activists such as Martin Luther King and CORE with their designation of Baltimore as a "Target City" that summer.

Mayor Theodore McKeldin reflected on the city's still limited progress Baltimore in June 1966:

> In response to those who might say that we have made significant progress in the field of civil rights, I could say that I agree; but, I would also have to say that there are problems – important problems – which have thus far not been resolved; and I believe that this City can no longer delay meeting its responsibilities, both in the public and private sectors of community life.
> The fact is that while we have moved, we have not moved toward the solution of these problems with the speed and vigor with which we are capable.
> We have not really attempted, as a community, to understand the plight, the unrest, and the feelings of those who have been denied.
> We have not attempted to understand why, even after significant progress, our negro brethren still insist that all is not right nor community – that there is much to be done.[@mckeldin_state_1966]

Many Baltimoreans, black and white, supported McKeldin's commitment to continued progress on Civil Rights. In 1967, Mayoral candidate and City Council President [Thomas D'Alesandro III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_D%27Alesandro_III) defended busing as a strategy to relieve overcrowded schools. At his inauguration in December, D'Alesandro called "the city of hope" and. promised "to root out every cause or vestige of discrimination."[@baum_how_2011, 159] Unfortunately, as the next period of this study notes, D'Alesandro could not overcome these challenges in the ways he had hoped—stymied by the unrest following the assasination of Martin Luther King in 1968 among other factors.

In the following sections, this study continues to describe the buildings and landscapes associated with the movement and highlight three key topics that shaped Baltimore's Civil Rights movement in this period:

- The desegregation of public schools and public accommodations
- The changing mix of elected officials, public agencies, and activist organizations that shaped the Civil Rights movement
- The transformation of housing and neighborhoods in the Baltimore region through racial transition, highway development, public housing and urban renewal projects

## Associated Places

The breadth and intensity of the Civil Rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s resulted in a wide range of associated buildings.

Some places are associated with the stubborn persistence of segregation in this period. Examples include the many public schools located in neighborhoods that transitioned from white to black in the late 1940s and early 1950s and expanded to accommodate the growing student population within a still-segregated system. These buildings serve as a reminder how white Baltimoreans clung to the idea that they could grant African Americans "Equal Rights" without permiting integration.

The Melvin Cade National Guard Armory is another example where the state decided to maintain a segregated black National Guard unit and, in 1960, erected a new building for the unit at 2620 Winchester Street. The new building became a civic and social center for African American residents in West Baltimore, hosting dance parties, lectures, and neighborhood meetings throughout the 1960s and 1970s. After the death of Melvin H. Cade, commanding officer of the 229th Battalion of the Maryland National Guard, in 1964, the Guard renamed the building in his honor. Baltimore City listed the Armory on its historic landmark list in 2009.

Sites such as the complex of midcentury office buildings at State Center function endure a site of conflict reflecting how white residents, local and state elected officials

Others are associated with the success of a diverse community of Civil Rights activists (including students, artists, and more) in securing space for their continued efforts. One example is the Campus YMCA located in Levering Hall at the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University.

Another example is the Arena Playhouse at 801 McCulloh Street occupied by the Arena Players, an African American theatre troupe, since 1962. Established in 1953 as an outgrowth of the "The Negro Little Theater", the Arena Players spent a decade performing at varied locations including Coppin State University, the Druid Hill YMCA, the Great Hall Theater of St. Mary's Church in Walbrook, and the Carl J. Murphy Auditorium at Morgan State University. After securing a long-term performance space, the Arena Players acquired the building in 1969 and through the 1970s continued to serve "as one of the only venues dedicated to showcasing the works of black playwrights and performers."[@arena_players_inc_history]

> The campus YMCA at Johns Hopkins was located at Levering Hall and joined with the Office of the Chaplain. Beginning in 1953, Chester Wickwire served as both the executive secretary of the YMCA and the university's chaplain. Wickwire and his staff aided in the development of student activism by providing a haven for liberals on an otherwise conservative campus. Out of Levering Hall, Wickwire ran various student life programs such as concerts, dances, and movie screenings while simultaneously organizing political discussions about civil rights, pacifism, the Cold War, and Vietnam. Dr. Wickwire himself had strong liberal views. He was a perennial figure in Baltimore civil rights activity who served on human relations committees, organized protests, and later helped to give protection to the Black Panthers.

## Desegregation for education and public accommodations after _Brown_ 

Activism around the desegregation of Baltimore's public schools and public accomodations, such as parks, pools, and public-serving businesses, clearly predate the 1954 Supreme Court decision in *Brown v. Board of Education*.

Between 1938 and 1940, the Baltimore Urban League and NAACP joined in private  negotiations with downtown department store owners and seeking to end their discriminatory policies against African American shoppers.[@kramer_white_2003, 43] Civil Rights leaders met again with a representative of the Retail Merchants Association in February 1943.[@kramer_white_2003, 48]  In 1945, the *Afro-American* newspaper made a public push for change by naming specific downtown stores as "Orchids" or "Onions" depending on their treatment of African American shoppers.[@farrar_baltimore_1998] The 1930s and 1940s also saw legal and activist efforts to desegregation Baltimore's public parks and recreational facilities.

In the late 1940s, Carl Murphy and Juanita Jackson Mitchell began pushing to desegregate Baltimore public schools and, in 1952, the NAACP and Thurgood Marshall successfully forced the city permit a small group of African American students to enroll at the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute.[@baum_how_2011, 155; @templeton_admission_1954; @thomsen_integration_1983]

However, the *Brown* decision pushed these issues to the forefront of the local debate and encouraged the years of activism that followed.

### School desegregation

![White supremacist leader Bryant Bowles at rally against school desegregation in Baltimore, 1954 October 5. Courtesy [Washington Area Spark/Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/washington_area_spark/32600844591/)](https://baltimoreheritage.github.io/civil-rights-heritage/assets/images/1954-10-05-bryant-bowles-washington_area_spark.jpg)

In 1954, the Supreme Court decision in  _[Brown v. Board of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education)_

 made the segregation of Maryland's schools illegal—overturning the court's decision in _Plessy v. Ferguson_ fifty-eight years before. African Americans in Maryland and around the nation struggled to see change in the face of both visible ["massive resistance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_resistance) and more subtle or invisible forms of resistance.

The _Brown v. Board of Education_ decision brought much broader changes to Baltimore's political and social institutions than just public schools. Progress in securing legal protections for Civil Rights and growing support from white elected officials was tempered by the fast-pace of racial transition in many Baltimore neighborhoods. In 1955, the _Baltimore Sun_ published a series, and  “The City We Live In,” highlighting issues around race and civil rights. That same year, the Baltimore City Council published “A City in Transition,” addressing the same issues. In 1956, the Council passed the Baltimore City Equal Employment Ordinance.

### Public accommodations

Three main aspects to department store "racial practices":

1. Discrimination in employment (only hired as maitenance or stockroom workers, elevator operators, porters, and restroom attendants; not higher-paying, higher-status jobs)
2. Refusal to serve African American customers at lunch counters
3. Policies prohibiting African American customers from trying on or returning clothing ("Final Sale" policy)

"Final Sale" policy based on  (p. 41):

> anxieties and fears about physical contact between whites and blacks. For most whites, blacks represented sources of unspecified physical and moral pollution ... Black and white boadies might "touch" in the exchange of forks and plates at store lunch-counters. Even more threatening to whites was the possibility that the clothes they tried on or purchased might bear an invisible taint of black physical contact.[@kramer_white_2003, 41]

- early 1943: Baltimore NAACP fought state Jim Crow laws; repeal bill sent to state legislature *Hygine Committee* rather than *Judiciary Committee* [@kramer_white_2003, 42]

> The downtown department stores, as some of Baltimore's most prominent sites of civic culture and modernity, were a principal target for anti-racist protests by individuals and organizations from the 1930s through the early 1960s.[@kramer_white_2003]

In writing about the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the NHL report notes:

> Thus, in contrast to education, the labor force, and suffrage, desegregation of public accommodations posed less of a challenge to traditional notions of racial equality as defined in terms of individual access as opposed to group preferences. [@salvatore_civil_2004, 82]

November 1953: “If You Ask Me,” Afro-American Newspaper, Mrs. B.M. Phillips:

>Thanks to the Committee On Racial Equality, (CORE), the Urban league, and the Americans for Democratic Action, (ADA), more stores in the 200 block W. Lexington st. are realizing there is no color line in the dollars you spend. Lunch counters and restaurants in the Kresge and Woolworth Five and Ten have been serving all customers for several weeks. McCrory's has just reversed its policy and will serve all comers […] Schulte United in the 200 block Lexington is still acting silly.”[@phillips_if_1953]

Downtown Department stores

- 1940s: Department stores discrimination against shoppers targeted by Afro American in the Orchids & Onions campaign. Onions included the May Company, Stewart's Department Store, and Hutzler's.
- 1960 March 26: Black student activists attempted to purchase food at department store restaurants at the Northwood Shopping Center and downtown; black students were attempting to buy lunch at four downtown department stores, only successful at Hochschild Kohn. Stewart's shut its food counters to all, white and black, and closed the food operation. About 20 blacks entered a Hutzler's restaurant and waited for three hours, but were not served.
- 1960 April 17: Issue resolved on Easter Sunday when the _Sun_ reported that store executive Albert D. Hutzler met with civil rights leaders Furman Templeton, David Glenn and Robert B. Watts, then announced “We have lifted restrictions. Negroes will be served in our restaurants.” Hecht-May and other stores followed.

#### 1955: ICC ends separate but equal doctrine for interstate transportation

> To this end, on December 14, 1953, the NAACP petitioned the ICC to void all segregation rules promulgated by transportation companies and applied to the facilities they maintained. Shortly after, on May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court issued its landmark opinion in _Brown v. Board of Education_, which outlawed public school segregation. In conformity with this ruling, on November 7, 1955, the ICC announced that the separate but equal doctrine was dead with respect to interstate transportation. [@salvatore_civil_2004, 44]

#### 1956: _Gayle v. Browder_ rules against racial segregation on intrastate transportation  

> The legal battle reached a climax when Montgomery and Alabama state officials appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court in _Gayle v. Browder_. On November 13, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's ruling and stipulated that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited racial segregation on intrastate as well as interstate transportation. [@salvatore_civil_2004, 46]

## August 1957: Suburbanization following end of racial discrimination

> "The big downtown stores and business have not welcomed colored people in the past... Their white only customers have moved to the suburbs and the colored customers they spurned are moving out too. So the heart of the city is no longer Lexington and Howard Sts."

## March 1958: Report on public accommodation

> BALTIMORE According to the annual report of the Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations, the following places of public accommodations are open to all.

Context around the U.S.:

> During the 1950s, a number of northern and western states adopted legislation prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations. Joining the eighteen states with such laws already on the books were Oregon (1953), Montana (1955), New Mexico (1955), Vermont (1957), Maine (1957), Idaho (1959), and Alaska (1959). In 1961, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming brought the total number of states with anti-segregations statutes up to twenty-eight. In addition, several cities in states that did not have public accommodations laws passed their own versions, including Wilmington, Delaware; Baltimore, Maryland; St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri; and El Paso, Texas. [@salvatore_civil_2004, 50]

#### 1960: Civic Interest Group organizes protests at the Northwood Shopping Center

> During the 1950s some progress had been made as CORE led sit-ins to desegregate downtown variety store lunch counters, and students from Morgan State College, a black school, desegregated lunch counters at Read's Drug Store in the Northwood Shopping Center, located a mile from the college. By the time of the Greensboro demonstrations, the main public accommodations still segregated consisted of beauty shops, restaurants, and the women's apparel sections of department stores. In 1960, Morgan State College students, organized under the banner of the Civic Interest Group, conducted protests at the Hecht-May store restaurant in Northwood and at Hutzler's department store restaurant. The disciplined group of students and their allies attracted a good deal of support from both the black and white communities. After three weeks of demonstrations, the department stores capitulated and abandoned segregation, pursuing their own best economic interests by reaching a solution. [@salvatore_civil_2004, 57]

#### 1963: Maryland adopts a public accommodations law

> The most vexing problem in this respect concerned the treatment non-white African officials received while traveling along Maryland's Highway 40, which they rode en route from the U.N. in New York City to Washington, D.C. On numerous occasions, the diplomats stopped for a meal at a Maryland restaurant, which denied them service as it did for African Americans. Brought to the attention of President Kennedy, he initially remarked: "Tell these ambassadors I wouldn't think of driving from New York to Washington. Tell them to fly!" Nevertheless, the Kennedy Administration did try to tackle the problem. The Office of Special Protocol Services within the State Department took the unusual step of sending its director, Pedro A. Sanjuan, to testify before the Maryland legislature in support of a public accommodations bill under consideration. Normally, state legislatures did not hear from State Department officials in the course of their duties. However, Sanjuan made it clear that the struggle for racial democracy within Maryland was explicitly linked to the country's ability to conduct the Cold War. "GIVE US THE WEAPONS TO CONDUCT THIS WAR ON HUMAN DIGNITY," he insisted, which the battle against communism demanded.196 Despite initial reluctance, Maryland adopted a public accommodations law in January 1963, thereby assisting American citizens of color and non-white foreigners alike and providing more ammunition for the nation's Cold War propaganda arsenal. [@salvatore_civil_2004, 64]

End to legalize segregation in public accommodations

>The Baltimore City Council finally ended legalized segregation in public accommodations in 1962. A state referendum on open accommodations passed in Maryland in 1964, despite failing on the Eastern Shore, much of Western Maryland, and in Baltimore and Anne Arundel counties.[@thompson_civil_1996, 373]

>In late February, 1964, the NAACP also had a large hand in the passage of the Baltimore City Public Accommodations and Fair Employment Practice Ordinances, which guaranteed an end to lawful discrimination in "employment practices, educational institutions, places of public accommodation, resort or amusement, and health and welfare agencies."[@shoemaker_we_1994, 265]

## Changes for elected officials and activists

Changes for activists included:

- An expanded student movement
- The growing reach of Black Power organizations
- The growing women's movement

### Black elected officials

### Student movement

### Black power movement

The Black Power movement emerged during this period and helped to bring national attention to Civil Rights issues in Baltimore. This change took place at both the national and local level, exemplified by the founding of the Black Panther Party and the advocacy efforts of CORE in the late 1960s. From July 1 to July 4 1964, the Congress of Racial Equality held their national convention in Baltimore. CORE focused national attention on Baltimore again in 1966 when they announced Baltimore as the organization's first "Target City."

On July 11, 1966, the Civic Interest Group (CIG) held a press conference at St. Peter Claver's Catholic Church to publicly endorse black power and announce that "it would no longer avoid violence in cases of 'self-defense'."

On October 1, 1966, the Black Panther Party was founded in Oakland.

### Neighborhood racial transition after 1954

The issue of racial transition reached Edmondson Village around 1955, when the first black residents moved west of the Gwynns Falls to live in the southeast corner of the region, around the western end of the Baltimore Street Bridge. One white resident remarked on the experience to historian Ed Orser:

>When the [black] people started moving into the neighborhood, they did come in, literally block by block. I can recall when they came across the… bridge, everybody was very upset; they said, 'Oh my God, they're over the bridge now; our street will be next.'[@orser_blockbusting_1994]

In July 1958, Allendale-Lyndhurst improvement Association (?) president L.E. Larsen gave the association's support to a plan sponsored by the Baltimore Urban League, the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations, and the Citizens Planning and Housing Association to “combat the conversion of Baltimore areas from all-white to all-Negro occupancy.” Larsen observed that Edmondson Village:

>already faced with pressure from block-busting realtor tactics and population shifts… the exodus from the city of the stable core of responsible citizens will likely be accelerated and the inevitable consequences will be a set-back to many of the long-range plans now being developed and implemented.

The issue reached Edmondson Village around 1955, when the first black residents moved west of the Gwynns Falls to live in the southeast corner of the region, around the western end of the Baltimore Street Bridge. One white resident remarked on the experience, commenting to Dr. Ed Orser:

> "When the [black] people started moving into the neighborhood, they did come in, literally block by block. I can recall when they came across the… bridge, everybody was very upset; they said, 'Oh my God, they're over the bridge now; our street will be next.'"[@orser_blockbusting_1994]

In April 1958, the improvement group organized their annual meeting at School No. 88 located at Wildwood Parkway and Gelston Drive, hosting Chief Judge Delany Foster of the Orphans Court of Baltimore as the guest speaker. In July 1958, Association president L.E. Larsen gave the association's support to a plan sponsored by the Baltimore Urban League, the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations, and the Citizens Planning and Housing Association to "combat the conversion of Baltimore areas from all-white to all-Negro occupancy." Larsen observed that Edmondson Village:

> "already faced with pressure from block-busting realtor tactics and population shifts… the exodus from the city of the stable core of responsible citizens will likely be accelerated and the inevitable consequences will be a set-back to many of the long-range plans now being developed and implemented."

An African American resident in this period later shared her experience in an oral history with Dr. Ed Orser, remarking:

> "When we first moved to the neighborhood, it was more white – we were just about the second black family on this block... We could see the changes, because when we moved, there were so many sale signs all around, and it did make a difference in the neighborhood, because there was a change, and you had to get yourself adjusted to the people who were moving in, and you couldn't really know the ones who were moving out, because they were leaving so fast, so we were really going through a transitional stage. People were moving in and out overnight; you didn't really know who your neighbors were. It was a difficult period, because when we moved, we thought maybe the neighborhood would be stabilized; it just wasn't."[@orser_blockbusting_1994]

According to [Indyreader](https://indyreader.org/content/history-housing-policy-and-segregation-baltimore)

> In the period between 1950 and 1964, Baltimore embarked on an aggressive urban renewal program that displaced more than 25,000 people, 85% of them African-American.  In 1953, the City's Redevelopment Commission designated eight areas of the city to be redeveloped, including urban renewal projects in Waverly and the area just west of Johns Hopkins Hospital.  In Waverly, a residential and commercial project that included 290 apartments and 270 parking spaces was designated by the Redevelopment Commission for white occupants only. 

On May 26, 1957, the _Baltimore Sun_ reported, HOUSING SEEN RACE HURDLE: N.A.A.C.P. Official Assails Rent, Purchase Setup:

> Negro and white families alike suffer from existing practices of segregation in housing. Clarence Mitchell, director of the Washington branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said here last night.[@_housing_1957]

#### 1959: Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. founded by James Rouse, Ellsworth Rosen, and Sidney Hollander, Jr.

According to a [short history of Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc.](http://www.bni-maryland.org/Documents/History.pdf) in 1959:

> In the 1950's a group of enlightened Baltimore homeowners sought to enlist like-minded civic and neighborhood organizations and the business community to encourage stable, integrated neighborhood housing "white flight" from the City. Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. (BNI), incorporated in March of 1959 by James Rouse, Ellsworth Rosen, and Sidney Hollander, Jr.

By 1960, however, the area south of Edmondson Village had changed from more than 99% white in 1950 to 62% black in 1960 and, a decade later, 92% black in 1970. Edmondson Village itself remained 99% white in 1960 but had changed to 97% black by 1970.[@orser_blockbusting_1994]

Although little evidence documents widespread physical violence on a scale comparable to white antagonists in Detroit or Chicago, the State Commission on Interracial Problems observed in 1958, "The problem it said, is not with violence 'but with the frigid withdrawal' of whites from the Negroes." During the late 1950s, the State Commission and others finally engaged with the ongoing process of racial transition with the beginning of advocacy and organizing efforts to promote "neighborhood stabilization."

On Feb 27, 1961, the _Baltimore Sun _ reported under the headline "Minor Difference?: Race And Renewal," writing:

> After leaders of the city's renewal agency and the Baltimore branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People faced each other for two hours across the Mayor's office recently, Mayor Grady summed up their dispute as "a minor difference of words."[@lukas_minor_1961]

#### 1966: George P. Mahoney runs for Governor in campaign opposing open housing

<!-- TODO: Look for "Registration Figures - General Election November 8,1966"; Durr, Behind the Backlash, 137; -->

As Richard Hardesty, in "'A Veil of Voodoo': George P. Mahoney, Open Housing, and the 1966 Governor's Race," observed:

> The 1966 governor's race represented Mahoney's most notorious campaign. His stand against open housing defined the election and offers an opportunity for a deeper look into this legendary figure. Although Spiro T. Agnew won the 1966 governor's race, Mahoney represented the campaign's central figure. He based his entire campaign on his opposition to open housing. Espoused in the slogan, "Your Home is Your Castle—Protect It," Mahoney capitalized on the growing white backlash to narrowly win the Democratic nomination in September 1966. At a time when crime, tax reform, and a new constitution represented Maryland's most pressing issues, Mahoney focused the public's attention on open housing, turning the national issue of civil rights into the primary focus of a statewide campaign. [@hardesty_veil_2009]

During the Democratic Party primary, a "white backlash" against open housing led enough voters to Mahoney for him to win the primary, including Baltimore where a split endorsement between Senator Verda Welcome and Clarence Mitchell diminished the power of African American voters, as Hardesty noted:

> Nonetheless, Mahoney still managed to carry Baltimore City by 2,236 votes. The white backlash played a key role in the victory. By opposing open housing, Mahoney gained the support of a considerable portion of the city's white working-class population. These working-class whites supported Mahoney, even though the Maryland AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers (U.A.W.) endorsed Sickles. For example, in East Baltimore's Ward I, Mahoney received sixty-eight percent of the vote. Mahoney's success led Albert Mattes of the U.A.W to declare that "members of organized labor have deserted their union in the field of political action." [@hardesty_veil_2009]

Despite Mahoney's success in the primary, he lost to Spiro Agnew in the general election with key support from African American voters in Baltimore, as Richard Hardesty noted:

> Most of all, Agnew secured victory by capturing Baltimore City through a coalition that included middle- and-upper-class voters, Jewish voters, and African American voters. Baltimore City had the highest voter registration totals in Maryland. In all, the city had 411,055 registered voters, of which 337,558 were registered Democrats. Agnew carried the city with 114,262 votes, and, while he did not win a majority, he defeated Mahoney by a comfortable margin. For his part, Mahoney ran strongly with white working class voters. Kenneth D. Durr noted that "the same working-class whites who had voted by a 64 percent margin for George Wallace gave Mahoney 71 percent of the vote." […] Divided during the Democratic primary, prominent African American leaders such as Clarence Mitchell III and Verda Welcome expressed little concern about bolting the Democratic Party. Furthermore, the predominantly African American Fourth District threw its support behind Agnew. African Americans helped Agnew win Baltimore City as well as the governorship."  [@hardesty_veil_2009]

### Urban renewal, transportation, and land use

In 1956, the state selected the Mount Royal area as an urban renewal site for the development of the State Center office complex.

<!-- QUESTION:How to talk about the rise of black power and the changes that CORE and the Black Panther Party brought to Civil Rights in Baltimore? How to talk about city and state politics? How did approaches to organizing in the Civil Rights movement change during this period? Does this period represent a move away from interracial organizing? What role did anti-communism play in that change? -->

<!-- TODO: Do we try to incorporate information on police brutality into this section of the text? -->

<!-- 

## Police Brutality

In July 1967, again according to [Baltimore Police History](http://baltimorecitypolicehistory.com/), the Baltimore City Police established the first of four "Community Relations Store Front Operations" noting, "The purpose of these centers is to reach the community on an intimate basis. This was the first such project in the Northeastern region of the United States."

>"A society that refuses to give some of its people equal rights and opportunities creates frustrations whose brunt is thrown at the police because they are the obvious protectors of an unjust order." Bayard Rustin speaking in Baltimore (from Baltimore Community Relations Commission report, 1966 or 67)
