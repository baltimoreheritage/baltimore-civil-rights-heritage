## Introduction

The Great Depression began with the stock market crash in October 1929. For African Americans in Baltimore, the economic crisis meant widespread job loss and poverty. New Deal relief efforts through the Works Progress Administration and Public Works Administration reinforced the city's existing patterns of segregation and discrimination by using public money to tear down black "slum" housing and by providing black families smaller relief payments than white families. The _Baltimore Afro-American_ observed in a 1933 editorial that "Baltimore is a border city with Southern feelings" reflecting on the persistent racism of many white residents and elected officials.[@thompson_civil_1996, 11] From the 1930s through the 1950s, African Americans in Baltimore, joined by some white supporters, organized and pursued a renewed campaign of protests, fighting for equal employment and education at home in Baltimore and helping lead the effort for these civil rights around the country.

The rapid growth of the city's black population during the 1940s, following the beginning of World War II, pushed the issues of housing and criminal injustice to the forefront alongside continuing efforts to expand opportunities for black workers. After a Baltimore City police officer shot and killed a black private in the U.S. Army from Pittsburgh, a coalition of local activists organized the 1942 March on Annapolis—the largest Civil Rights demonstration in the history of the state—and won important new changes. The election of  Republican Mayor Theodore McKeldin (after over a decade of leadership by Democratic Mayor Howard W. Jackson) provide African American leaders with a potential ally after years of frustration.

After the war ended in 1948, Baltimore saw a wave of major changes as African American residents, who had struggled under a severe housing shortage for decades, began buying homes in an expanding area of west Baltimore (west of Fulton Avenue) and in east Baltimore.  In 1951, the Maryland legislature finally changed state laws that had required racial segregation on trains and boats and, by 1953, five years of protests by activists and students finally forced the desegregation of Ford's Theatre on Fayette Street in downtown Baltimore. On the eve of the monumental Supreme Court decision in _Brown v. Board of Education_, the Civil Rights Movement in Baltimore had already started to radically transform life in the city.

Within this period, this study describes four key themes in detail:

- **Criminal Injustice**: Baltimore activists participated in national anti-lynching advocacy and fought police and mob violence in Baltimore. Activist efforts led to the city's first black uniformed police officers following the 1942 March on Annapolis.
- **Employment and Education**: As the NAACP continued to campaign against segregated schools locally and nationally, black educators and administrators continued to build on the 1921 Strayer Report to improve conditions for Baltimore's black students. Black workers also sought better conditions and more job opportunities and found a partner in the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).
- **Public Accommodations**: White allies and African American students served as key supporters for activist efforts that opened public parks and recreational facilities, along with some (but not all) shops, restaurants, and theaters by the early 1950s.
- **Housing**: A severe shortage of housing created difficult conditions for thousands of black Baltimoreans. This issue framed the struggle to build public housing for African Americans and pursue opportunities to purchase homes in formerly segregated white neighborhoods after WWII.

<!-- TODO: Revise the comments from Thompson and Cumberbatch below into a brief summary that describes how historians see this period as important. I need a copy of the Cumberbatch thesis! -->

Historian Prudence Denise Cumberbatch described the period between 1929 and 1945 as one of the "key social and political eras in the history of Baltimore".[@cumberbatch_working_2001] Another historian, Bruce Thompson, noted how in this period, "Baltimore became a model for organizing blacks at the grassroots level to support the fight for black civil rights."[@thompson_civil_1996, 373] Cumberbatch highlights the internal debates within black Civil Rights movement in this period of growth:

>[activists considered] whether or not their chances for success would be better if they formed alliances with radical political organizations, concentrated on intraracial campaigns, or placed their hopes in the policies of the federal government.

Cumberbatch concludes that African American activists in Baltimore incorporated all three strategies into their efforts to respond to the "immediate concerns of their community, be they mob violence or the treatment of workers in the steel mill."[@cumberbatch_working_2001] In contrast to the nineteenth century, this new movement relied on support from churches but largely followed secular leaders.[@thompson_civil_1996, 366]

The new leadership of activists in this period began in 1931 when Juanita Jackson organized the City-Wide Young Peoples Forum. Through this work, hundreds of young people created and lent their support to a campaign, "Buy Where You Can Work," that protested the refusal of businesses on Pennsylvania Avenue to hire black workers. Bruce Thompson quotes Nannie H. Burroughs who called the group:

>the best, most progressive, and analytical organization of Negro young people in America. It feels, thinks, believes, acts.[@thompson_civil_1996, 42]

Thompson continues to note:

>Although several whites spoke at the Forum, the list of blacks speakers who addressed the Forum between 1931 and 1935 reads like a Who's Who of Black Americans. W. E. B. Du Bois, Walter White, Roy Wilkins, William Pickens, Charles H. Houston, and other civil rights leaders spoke at the Forum. So did Mary McLeod Bethune, Nannie H. Burroughs, E. Franklin Frazier, James Weldon Johnson, Sterling Brown, George Schuyler, Congressman Oscar DePriest, Carter G. Woodson, Reverend A. Clayton Powell, Sr., and other prominent black leaders.[@thompson_civil_1996, 51]

Two of Baltimore's most well known Civil Rights leaders came of age during this period. By 1934, Thurgood Marshall, a young lawyer who was born and raised in the West Baltimore community of African Americans that had been growing in size and strength for decades, began working for the local chapter of the NAACP. From his work in Baltimore, Marshall went on to lead the national civil rights fight in the courts and eventually became the nation's first African American Supreme Court Justice. As Marshall was winning court cases for the NAACP in Baltimore and nationally, in 1935, Jaunita Jackson's mother Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson took over as president of the Baltimore NAACP chapter. The group had struggled with financial stability since its founding but Jackson transformed it into one of the largest chapters in the country. She served as its president for 35 years and during that time pioneered tactics such as non-violent protests and voter registration drives that later were used across the country. 

As Baltimore's African American residents formed new groups and new leaders emerged who helped push the Civil Rights Movement forward nationally, white activists and interracial organizations also reemerged as important allies in the 1930s and 1940s after the collapse of white support for civil rights in the late nineteenth century. The American Communist Party (established in 1919) expanded its advocacy for civil rights in Maryland during the 1930s. The ACLU of Maryland was founded on March 8, 1931. By the early 1950s, Baltimore had a local chapter of the interracial activist group the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) (founded in Chicago in March 1942). One local ally group was the white-led Hollander Foundation, established by Sidney Hollander, Sr. Among other activities to support the fight for civil rights, the Hollander Foundation began publishing an annual report in 1946 "Toward Equality" that documented the condition of civil rights in Maryland.^[[Baltimore Sun, 2011](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-02-05/news/bs-md-backstory-race-relations-20110204_1_race-relations-report-restrictions)] As two leading black activists later  recalled, "there were always a few whites who braved the wrath and scorn and the ostracism to work" for civil rights.[@shoemaker_we_1994, 262]

<!-- TODO: Should I look more closely at voting and barriers to voting in this period? Do we need to include some statewide context in addition to the situation in Baltimore? -->

Electoral politics also reemerged as a major source of opportunity for black voters to advance their civil rights work in Baltimore and around the country. With new tactics like voter registration drives, black votes were key to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's reelection in 1936 and 1940. In 1934, Baltimore's black voters helped to defeat long-serving Democratic Maryland Governor Albert Ritchie in favor of Republican Harry Nice. In 1943, black voters were also helped to defeat the similarly long-serving Democratic Baltimore Mayor Howard W. Jackson in favor of Republican Theodore McKeldin. This 1943 election followed the first major effort by the NAACP to organize a  Register-and-Vote campaign. <!-- FIXME: Double-check the timing on the NAACP register to vote campaign. --> Historian Sandy M. Shoemaker quotes Reverend Marion Bascom, a Civil Rights activist and leader of Douglas Memorial Community Church, remarking how as mayor and later governor Theodore McKeldin was accessible to activists:

>People didn't have to have a 'sit-in' demonstration to see Mr. McKeldin. Mr. McKeldin was available and this, I think, made all the difference.[@shoemaker_we_1994, 262]

Support for Republican candidates Nice and McKedin, however, did not reverse the major realignment that was taking place as black voters switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party. For example, on December 3, 1946, Victorine Adams held the first meeting of the Colored Women's Democratic Campaign Committee. In 1954, Adams' efforts led to the election of Democrat Harry A. Cole, the first African American to serve in the Maryland General Assembly.

A diversity of viewpoints and approaches is represented in the key activists from the 1930s to the early 1950s: Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson, Thurgood Marshall, and Dr. Carl Murphy, who all worked closely with the local chapter and the national organization of the NAACP. Other important organizers and activists included Dr. John E.T. Camper (d. 1977) with the  Citizen's Committee for Justice and the Progressive Citizens of America (PCA); Victorine Q. Adams (1912–2006) with the Colored Democratic Women's Campaign Committee; and Edward Lewis with the Baltimore Urban League.

Others may not have served in formal leadership roles with civil rights organizations but supported the movement as plaintiffs, as workers integrating segregated institutions, and as participants in the growing use of direct action. NAACP's legal campaigns in Baltimore relied on the courage and persistence of individual plaintiffs such as Margaret Williams (b. 1923), Donald Gaines Murray (1914–1986), and Louise Kerr Hines (1916–2007). Others faced the challenge of being the first African American to integrate segregated institutions: Violet Hill Whyte (1897–1980) became Baltimore's first black non-uniformed police officer in 1937; Vivien Thomas (1910–1985) became one of the first black professional employees at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1941; Frederick I. Scott, Jr. (b. 1927) became one of the first black undergraduate students at Johns Hopkins University when he enrolled in 1945; and George Taliaferro became one of the first three black players for the Baltimore Colts football team in 1953.^[See more on the [history of African Americans at JHU](http://afam.nts.jhu.edu/people.html); see more on [Roland T. Smoot](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-01-27/news/0601270116_1_smoot-johns-hopkins-oral-history); [Taliaferro](http://cnsmaryland.org/2012/04/13/taliaferro-one-of-colts-first-black-players-recounts-times-in-baltimore/)] <!-- TODO: George Taliaferro feels like a random example. Maybe unecessary?--> Finally, hundreds of people marched in picket lines on Pennsylvania Avenue in the early 1930s, walked miles to march on Annapolis in 1942, and sat down at lunch counters on Lexington Street in the early 1950s.

Changes to city and state politics and the marked renewal of activist organizations reflected the growth of the city's African American population in both size and proportion. African American residents went from 17.66% of Baltimore's population in 1930 to 23.70% in 1950. The city's black population increased from 142,106 in 1930 to 225,099 in 1950—a 60% increase. This change outpaced the more modest 18% growth in the city's overall population. Two major factors drove this change: the large number of African Americans moving to Baltimore during World War II seeking work in wartime industries, and the growth of segregated white suburban communities in the surrounding counties. In Baltimore County, the largest county surrounding the city and a separate local jurisdiction, the overall population more than doubled from 124,565 in 1930 to 270,273 in 1950, much of the growth coming from segregated white suburban communities as white city dwellers left for the county. <!-- FIXME: How about the proportion of white to black residents in Balitmore County during this period? -->

The pattern of racial segregation in Baltimore continues to result in a concentration of important places associated with the movement in historically segregated black neighborhoods. Examples include the MeDoSo Club House (the meeting place for a group of black doctors who donated generously to the NAACP) was located in a house at 1800 Eutaw Place; the segregated black Frederick Douglass High School (built in 1924) at 1601 N. Calhoun Street;  and Edgar Allan Poe Homes (built 1938) and McCulloh Homes (built 1940), two of the earliest public housing projects for African Americans. The residences of notable leaders were similarly in nearly all-black neighborhoods including the Dr. John E.T. Camper House (built c. 1885) at 639 N. Carey Street and the Dr. Carl J. Murphy House in Morgan Park.

However, Baltimore's Civil Rights historic sites are also tied to places where activists fought against segregation, including the former Catonsville High School (built 1925) which is closely associated with the case of Williams v. Zimmerman (1937); the Enoch Pratt Free Library – Branch No. 1 (built 1886) where Louise Kerr worked after successfully overturning a prohibition against black librarians in 1945; and the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (built 1913 and now the central office for the Baltimore City Public Schools at North Avenue and Calvert Street which began to desegregate on a limited basis in 1952.

## Criminal Injustice

![Euel Lee being transported to Baltimore City jail, 1931. Photo courtesy Washington Area Spark/Flickr.](/civil-rights-heritage/assets/images/1931-euel-lee-washingtonarea-spark.jpg)

<!-- TODO: This section is a bit of a mess right now. I'm not sure how to distinguish this from the prior 1905-1929 period except by the emphasis on the Euel Lee case and the 1942 March on Annapolis. Maybe that is enough? -->

<!-- [We are working on this section]. -->

Lynching and criminal injustice were at the center of black organizing and advocacy around Civil Rights and racial injustice in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Such cases highlighted the important role of the Communist Party in supporting African American Civil Rights as a strategy for building supporting among African Americans broadly.

On December 4, 1931, [Matthew Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Williams_(laborer)) was lynched at Salisbury, Maryland—as the Maryland Historical Society [underbelly blog](http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2012/11/29/an-american-tragedy/) notes:

> On December 4, 1931, Matthew Williams, an African American man, shot and killed his white employer in Salisbury and then turned the gun on himself in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. That evening, a mob of more than a thousand dragged Williams from his hospital bed where he lay critically wounded, and hung him up on the courthouse lawn. His body was then dragged to the town’s African American business district, and set on fire.  The Williams murder was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882, and the first since 1911.

On October 14, 1931, Euel Lee, known as "Orphan Jones," was arrested for the murder of a white family reportedly over a disagreement about wages. The Maryland Communist Party took Lee’s case and lawyer [Bernard Ades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Ades) successfully moved Lee’s trial to Towson in Baltimore County. Ultimately, Ades lost the case (Lee was executed on October 28, 1933) but the process of removing the case from the city's courts helped to combat the informal prohibition on black jurors in Baltimore County.^[Citation missing!]

<!-- TODO: What is the broader significance of the Euel Lee case for jury selection and due process? -->

Two years later, on October 18, 1935:

> a mob of a thousand or more people stormed into the Princess Anne jail house and hauled Armwood from his cell down to the street below. Before he was hung from a tree some distance away, Armwood was dragged through the streets, beaten, stabbed, and had one ear hacked off.  Armwood’s lifeless body was then paraded through the town, finally ending up near the town’s courthouse, where the mob doused the corpse with gasoline and set it on fire.

In 1948, for the first time in the history of Maryland, a white man was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape of a black woman.

## Education and Employment

The issues of education and employment are not only intertwined in the present but were also clearly understood as closely related by Civil Rights activists in this period. In this period, activists initiated new efforts and expanded existing ones around five themes:

- Equal resources for segregated black schools
- Desegregation for students and educators
- Public relief for black workers and families
- Organizing industrial black workers
- Public employment for black workers

### School equality

African American school administrator Francis Wood, a pioneering educator who led a transformation of the city's black schools, continued to build on the changes suggested by the Strayer Survey of Baltimore's schools in the early 1920s. Between 1929 and 1940, Wood increased attendance for black elementary and junior high school students above 85% and for black high school students above 90% .[@johnson_strayer_2012, 44] Beginning in 1926, Wood began to attend the annual conference organized by Carter G. Woodson's Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. As one tangible product from these conferences, Wood introduced a Negro History Week, which Woodson and the Study of Negro Life organization began in 1926, into Baltimore's black schools to celebrate the history of African Americans each February. Historian Johnson notes: "Each segregated school was responsible for creating and sponsoring their own Black History program.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 47]

Wood also worked at the national level serving as the president of the Association for Colored School Teachers "which fought for better schools and equality."[@johnson_strayer_2012, 47] However, Wood's investment in segregated schools may have come with an accommodationist perspective. He "warned African Americans that now was not the time to demand ―undue advantages."[@johnson_strayer_2012, 48] (Date? Source?)

One key achievement in this period was the 1944 (?) appointment of George F. W. McMechen, a 1895 graduate of Morgan College and an African American lawyer, to the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 51] The appointment followed a letter on April 9, 1942 from Dr. Carl Murphy, acting as chairman of the Baltimore Citizens Committee for Justice, to Mayor Jackson arguing for the appointment of an African American person to the school board.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 50] (Was this also related to the Commission on the Problems Affecting the Negro Population?)

### School desegregation

Even as Francis Wood, along with many black teachers and families, advocated for improvements to black schools within the segregated system, others fought to end school segregation at every level from elementary schools to universities.

The best known case nationally in this period was [Murray v. Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_v._Pearson) (1935) where Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston won Donald Gaines Murray the right to attend the University of Maryland School of Law. The court "noted the state's requirement under the Fourteenth Amendment, as it was understood at that time, to provide substantially an equal treatment in the facilities it provides from public funds. Since Maryland chose to only provide one law school for use by students in the state, that law school had to be available to all races." (Wikipedia)

In 1947, Dr. Ralph J. Young became the first African American to join teaching staff at Johns Hopkins Hospital and, in 1950, Frederick I. Scott becomes the first African American to graduate from Johns Hopkins University. As a private university in a Southern state, these advances were considerable. That same year, Juanita Jackson Mitchell became the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Maryland Law School.

### Public relief for black workers and families

![African American women and children receiving aid from the Baltimore Emergency Relief Commission photographed at home in their kitchen, 1934. Courtesy [Enoch Pratt Free Library, Enoch Barker Collection, Digital Maryland, mdaa152](http://collections.digitalmaryland.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/mdaa/id/195/rec/1030). ](/civil-rights-heritage/assets/images/mdaa152.jpeg)

 In 1934, 13% of Baltimore whites and 40% of Baltimore blacks were on relief according to a study by the Baltimore Urban League. While the federal government’s New Deal programs brought some assistance, discrimination persisted even in the administration of these programs. The _Afro-American_ reported that an African American household with eight people recieved $8.94 a week for food but a white household of the same size received $12.70.[@farrar_baltimore_1998, 92-98]

 >City relief was distributed by the Family Welfare Association, which reported in 1934 that 40 per cent of the city's blacks, compared to 13 per cent of its whites, were on relief. The Urban League and a local association of the unemployed, studied 150 white and black relief cases in the same year and discovered that black families typically received smaller relief sums and were removed from relief rosters before whites.[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 19]

 <!-- TODO: I read something related to the Urban League that referenced the depression beginning for black people in Baltimore around 1926. I'm sure that would be a pattern found in other cities if it is accurate. -->

 <!-- [We are working on documenting the civil rights response to public relief inequity] -->

### Organizing black workers

![Enoch Pratt Free Library Branch No. 1 on the northeast corner of Pitcher Street and Fremont Avenue, 1938. Courtesy [Enoch Pratt Free Library, Enoch Barker Collection, Digital Maryland, mdaa020](http://collections.digitalmaryland.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/mdaa/id/57/rec/907). ](/civil-rights-heritage/assets/images/mdaa020.jpeg)

Although African Americans made up a significant percentage of Baltimore residents and workers in the city, discrimination in labor organizing remained a challenge. Numbering 144,000 in a population of 817,000 in 1930, city blacks faced greater and different kinds of problems than whites. Substantial numbers were employed in 1930, but they occupied the lowest rung of the wage ladder. Indeed low wages for adult males had forced thousands of women, adolescents and the elderly on the job market to supplement meager family incomes. Eighty- five percent of employable black males held jobs in 1930 compared to 77 percent of native whites, and 51 percent of employable black women were wage earners, compared to 27 percent of native whites.[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 19]

Low-paying domestic service work offered some 26,000 jobs to Baltimore blacks in 1930, but as conditions worsened, hundreds of white employers, determined to "take care of their own" first, preferred whites over blacks. As some city industries began to recover from the Depression, they employed whites rather than rehire blacks, and by 1936, seventeen percent of Baltimore's employable, skilled black males were out of work.[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 19]

Baltimore's chapter of the Urban League recognized the disparity in job creation as the city recovered from the Depression. Conducting a survey of 115 retail and manufacturing firms in 1933, the group discovered that blacks constituted 8.3 per cent of the firm's employees in 1933, compared to 9.2 per cent in 1930[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 19] 

On the labor organizing front, White unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor continued to exclude black workers. The policy of "last hired and first fired" led to widespread job loss. Black workers fought back in ways big and small. In 1931, for example, black longshoremen walked out of a meeting of the City Federation of Labor rather than accept Jim Crow seating. 

Baltimore's white unions used a variety of tactics to try to keep black workers out of the workforce. These white unions occasionally violated or evaded even sacred commandments of labor. For example, when black brick layers arrived in the city, union cards in hand, they were offered free train fare out of the city, not the traditional welcome of new fellow union members. In another example, rather than work with black union hod-carriers (brick carriers), whites in the American Federation of Labor bricklayers' union used white scabs.[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 20]

<!-- TODO: What proportion of black workers were employed in the service sector? How did employment opportunities vary by gender? Could this be a good place to talk about employment for blind or deaf workers? Or about black entrepreneurship? -->

<!-- TODO: There must have been more going on for black workers in this period than just the CIO. I think small business ownership should also be incorporated into this section. -->

In the 1930s, African American activists put growing pressure on public and private employers to end segregated hiring and begin offering more opportunities for African American workers. This pressure included both renewed legal efforts backed by the NAACP at the local and national levels and a series of grass-roots protest actions organized by activist groups like CORE, inter-religious coalitions like the Baltimore Council of Churches, and by students (especially from Morgan State College). Another important supporter of labor reforms were black professional organizations such as the Progressive Engineers Association of Maryland (organized in 1938) and the MeDeSo Club (a club for black physicians and dentists established by Dr. J.E.T. Camper and others in 1942).

An early sign of progress came in July 1937 when the Baltimore Police Department hired Violet Hill Whyte as the city's first black police officer. Whyte was not a uniformed officer and did not carry a gun as part of her work, but she was an officer nonetheless. In a city where the police force was a significant source of violence against African Americans and often the front line in the suppression of civil rights, breaking the color barrier here was an enormous step forward.

On the national level, in 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 which established the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) and lay a foundation for broader activism against discriminatory hiring. Such efforts were frustrated, however, by the weak support of many industrial unions for black workers and the racism of white workers. This challenge is exemplified in the case of Bethlehem Steel in 1943 (?) when white workers walked off the job in protest over the hiring of black workers.

People working in the public sector had more success in the years after WWII than most who worked for private employers. In 1945, the NAACP won a critical legal victory to end a segregated training program at the Enoch Pratt Free Library. a city-run agency, in the case of Kerr v. Enoch Pratt Free Library (1945).[@jackson_discrimination_2008; @herzog_kerr_2007] In 1953, the Baltimore City Fire Department appointed its first African American firemen. In 1949, the Baltimore City Medical Society, a local professional association for doctors, voted to admit African American members.

## Public Accommodations

In some cases, public facilities in this period began to change willingly to include African American residents in ways they had not before. For example, the Baltimore Museum of Art held a "Negro Art Show" in 1947. However, many business owners maintained the policies of segregation that they had adopted in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The fight against segregated public accommodations expanded in this period from initiatives by formal Civil Rights organizations and from the activities of individual activists. Three notable locations for this activism and related conflicts include:

- Public parks and recreational facilities
- Theaters and stores
- Transportation facilities

### Parks and recreation

Baltimore's growing African American population made it more difficult in the 1930s for Baltimore City to sustain segregation at the city's parks and recreational facilities.[@kirsch_municipal_2007; @wells_separate_2008; @baidyaroy_blacks_2011] Efforts to desegregate the city's parks and recreation facilities is notable because it included prominent public protests led by whites and blacks. 

An early example of a mixed-race protest took place on December 17, 1947 when a group of white and black young people organized an integrated youth basketball game at Garrison Junior High School to protest segregationist policies. A year and a half later, on July 11, 1948, a group of young black and white tennis players organized a game on the tennis courts at Druid Hill Park. The protest led to a lawsuit against the city, Boyer v. Garrett (1949), that resulted in the court overturning the city's long-standing policy of racial segregation in city parks.^[[Copy of the decision](http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/88/353/1956786/).]

Not all protests were mixed race. For example, in September 1934, the Carroll Park golf course partly opened to African American golfers but limited black players to specific days and maintained separation from white players through staggered play. In 1938, two black golfers, Dallas Nicholas and William I. Gosnell, sued Baltimore City to try to overturn this policy but were unsuccessful.[@wells_separate_2008] <!-- TODO: Find more details about this suit. -->

Emboldened by this success, in 1950, a group of African American activists attempted to purchase tickets for the beach at [Fort Smallwood Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Smallwood_Park) a popular recreational park located in Anne Arundel County but owned and managed by Baltimore City.  <!-- TODO: What happened when they tried to buy tickets? --> 

 <!-- [We are expanding this section]. -->

Finally, in 1953, Governor Theodore McKeldin opened all state parks to African Americans.

 <!-- TODO: What does it mean that the state parks were open? Was this in practice or just in law only?  -->

### Theaters and stores

In this period of 1929 to 1954, many downtown department stores refused to allow black shoppers to try on clothes, return clothes after a purchase, or provide service to black shoppers at all. In addition, department restaurants and lunch counters refused to seat African Americans, offering them take out service or no service at all. The efforts to desegregate Baltimore's theaters and stores started early, and the leaders who emerged helped shape the national Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s. 

In response to the range of segregation policies, in 1945, the _Afro-American_ newspaper began the "Orchid and Onion" campaign to celebrate stores that did not discrimination against black shoppers ("Orchids") and shame downtown department stores with discriminatory policies ("Onions").[@farrar_baltimore_1998, 183] The multi-month campaign chronicled establishments that desegregated during this time and those that remained discriminatory.

Black people faced similar policies of separation and discrimination at local theaters as well as stores. In addition to refusing to sell tickets to African Americans, theaters often refused to book black musicians and performers. Activists took on these establishments. On February 1, 1948, for example, the Baltimore police arrested a group of Morgan State College students for picketing Ford's Theater on Fayette Street. The students and other activists soon returned and sustained a five-year campaign to end segregated seating at Ford's, finally succeeding in 1953. In another example, after the Lyric Theatre on Mt. Royal Avenue refused to allow singer and civil rights activist Marian Anderson to perform, Baltimore's Commission on Human Relations intervened and persuaded the theater owners to allow her to appear, which she did in January 1954 but only for a white audience. After the performance, white activist Sidney Hollander, Sr. hosted an afternoon reception for Anderson at his home so that at least a select group of African American could hear her. <!-- TODO: Where did Sidney Hollander, Sr. live?

## Housing

The New Deal and World War II led to major changes in the relationship of the city and state governments to housing in Baltimore and across the country. During the Great Depression, the was a shortage of new homes for both white and black buyers. For example, across the country, housing starts dropped by over 90% from a high of 937,000 in 1925 to 93,000 in 1933.[@hayward_baltimore_2001, 155]. This shortage kept existing homeowners fixed in place and stopped the process of racial transition that had been underway in west and east Baltimore neighborhoods since the 1880s. 

As the housing shortage began to end, the lines of segregation were further reinforced by a number of federal housing policies. One of these was the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) (established in 1933) that used now infamous "red-lining" maps to discourage lending in neighborhoods where African Americans lived. Other federal initiatives provided mixed results in Baltimore. The [National Housing Act of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Housing_Act_of_1934), for example, created the Federal Housing Administration and the [Housing Act of 1937].(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_Act_of_1937) While this act provided a new source of federal funding for cities like Baltimore, a portion of the money was used to engage in "slum clearance" in lower income predominately African American neighborhoods and build new public housing projects that led to the entrenchment of segregated housing even more. The federal government continued to shape housing policy after WWII with the approval of the Housing Act of 1949 on July 15, 1949.

These policy changes, and the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of _[Shelley v. Kraemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_v._Kraemer)_in 1948 ending the legal enforcement of  racial covenants shaped changes in Baltimore in the areas of:

- Public housing beginning in the late 1930s
- Private housing beginning in the mid-1940s through racial transition and "white flight"
- Transportation and land use policies that had a discriminatory affect on black neighborhoods


### Public housing

<!-- See @williams_living_1998 and @williams_politics_2004 -->

During the Great Depression, West Baltimore's "color line" had stabilized around Fulton Avenue. Beginning in the late 1940s, however, neighborhoods at the edge of Old West Baltimore west of Fulton Avenue began to transition from white to black. The change was driven by a number of factors including the rapid growth of Baltimore’s African American population during the 1940s and 1950s, the intense overcrowding and deteriorating housing conditions within historically segregated African American neighborhoods throughout the city and the movement of white households out of the center city to the areas of new development in the Baltimore suburbs. All of this led to a severe housing shortage for African Americans. 

From January 1941 to November 1941 alone, housing vacancies for units open to African American occupancy shrank from .8% to .1%. In a letter to Mayor McKeldin in July 1945, in response to the efforts by a group of 350 residents in the Fulton Avenue area to prevent black residents from moving west, the NAACP argued "growth demands that we take in those streets that fringe our area since every attempt to enter new sections is vigorously denied." The Citizens Committee for Justice and the Baltimore Urban League observed "the need for more housing is most sharply felt in the Negro community, where there are virtually no vacancies of any type."[@_mayor_1945]

As another testament to the housing shortage and discriminatory housing practices, an October 1948 editorial in the Baltimore Sun described the "colored section of most cities" as "already dangerously overcrowded" and noted that only 2% of new housing built in 1948 was open to African Americans, despite representing 20% of Baltimore’s total population.[@_small_1948] By 1950, Baltimore had 226,053 black residents, representing 23.8% of the population but occupying only 19.4% of dwelling units. This pattern continued into the early 1950s: of the 53,000 permits issued new homes in the Baltimore metropolitan area from 1950 to 1953, only 3,200 of those were open to African American households, even as the black population increased another 10%.

### Racial transition and "white flight"

When African American residents began responding to the housing crisis by purchasing homes in formerly segregated white neighborhoods, many white residents sold their houses and left, or met the new African American families with violence. 

In one example in 1945, a group of people, described by the _Baltimore Afro American_ as "hoodlums who resented having the Millers move into a white neighborhood," threw bricks at the home of James Miller and his family at 816 N. Fulton Avenue, breaking glass in the front door and windows.[@_fulton_1945] The newspaper expanded on this account writing:

>Of at least fifty houses on Fulton Avenue now owned by colored persons between the 500 and 1800 blocks, only one case of violence has been reported by one of the three families now known to occupy homes there. The James Miller family, which moved into 816 N. Fulton Avenue on February 15, reported that bricks were thrown through a window and door panel on the following Saturday. The second floor of this house is occupied by the William Montgomery family… Among Fulton Avenue property owners are the Rev. Hiram J. Smith, Dr. Bruce Alleyne and the Medicos Club, an organization of physicians and dentists. "For Sale" signs may be seen all along Fulton Avenue.[@_50_1945]

In another example in August 1948, a house on the 1300 block of Payson Street just to the north of the district was subject to an arson attempt, attributed to retaliation against a white Jewish home-owner who had "broken" the block by selling a property to an African American homeowner in 1946.[@_racial_1948] In July 1950 after Ms. Beatrice Sessoms, a native of North Carolina who came to Baltimore in 1948, moved with her nephew to the 2300 block of Lauretta Avenue, her house was attacked.^[@_home_1950] Baltimore historian Edward Orser quotes one black West Baltimore resident recalling the experience of white flight in the late 1940s:

>Black people started moving out of the confined areas somewhere around 1947 or 1948, but what would happen was that whites would evacuate a block or two blocks, and black people would move in. The evacuation would take place first. I remember streets like Fulton Avenue, Monroe Street—they were once totally white, and they went through the transition and changed somewhere between 1946 and 1949—that was the time I was in service. When I went in, there were no black people when I came out, there they were black streets… But it wasn’t integration… it was an evacuation.[@orser_blockbusting_1994]

These initial movements soon accelerated, particularly in west and northwest areas of Baltimore. Lula Jones Garrett, a columnist for the _Baltimore Afro_, observed in a column titled "Change-the-Address New Game on Baltimore Front" writing:

>What with the local yokels forsaking the ghettos and moving into swankier mansions, it takes a special edition of the directory to locate your best friends these days."[@garrett_change--address_1949]

The process of this rapid transition is closely associated with negative accounts of realtors or "block-busters" using a range of tactics to take advantage of both white sellers and black buyers. For example, during the 1940s and 1950s many African American owners purchased homes under land-installment contracts or buy-like-rent arrangements, also known as lease option contracts, that allowed home-owners to purchase property without an initial down payment or closing charges. Although appealing, these arrangements did not immediately transfer title to the property and the contract could still be terminated if the new homeowner missed a single payment. Although the black home ownership rate rose by 194% between 1940 and 1950, in comparison to 58.8% for whites, a 1955 survey by the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations found that 53% of their respondents had purchased their homes through such predatory arrangements rather than regular financing that was open to whites.^[Citation missing – maybe Orser (1994).]

Although little evidence documents widespread physical violence on a scale comparable to white antagonists in Detroit or Chicago, the State Commission on Interracial Problems observed in 1958, "The problem it said, is not with violence 'but with the frigid withdrawal' of whites from the Negroes." During the late 1950s, the State Commission and others finally engaged with the ongoing process of racial transition with the beginning of advocacy and organizing efforts to promote "neighborhood stabilization."[@_negro_1958]

### Transportation and land use

The ramifications of the disparate impact of highway construction on black neighborhoods began to take shape during this period. At the most basic level, white households were more likely to own cars and African American households were more likely to rely on public transportation.

Beyond the inequity of public funds going disproportionately to transportation projects that largely benefited whites, a series of road building and widening projects in the 1930s and 1940s brought increased noise and automotive traffic to largely black neighborhoods. Examples include the construction of the Howard Street extension and bridge over the Jones Falls in 1938 (which displaced African American households) and the widening of Druid Lake Drive in the early 1940s. In 1949, the NAACP protested a proposal to convert Druid Hill Avenue into a one-way street but was unsuccessful in reversing the move. The most notable of the proposed road projects in Baltimore during this period was the 1944 plan for an east-west highway prepared by New York planner Robert Moses. The plan would have required the demolition of two hundred city blocks and displaced nineteen hundred residents. Unfazed, Moses suggested, "Nothing which we propose to remove will constitute any loss to Baltimore."[@pietila_not_2010, 219] Moses further argued that the demolition of "slums" was a benefit as "the more of them that are wiped out the healthier Baltimore will be in the long run."^[Citation needed!]
