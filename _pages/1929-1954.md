## Introduction

The Great Depression that began with the stock market crash in October 1929 presented major challenges as African Americans in Baltimore suffered from widespread job loss and poverty. New Deal relief efforts through the Works Progress Administration and Public Works Administration continued to reinforce decades of segregation and discrimination; even offering black families smaller relief payments than white families. The _Baltimore Afro-American_ observed in a 1933 editorial that "Baltimore is a border city with Southern feelings".[@thompson_civil_1996, 11] African American Civil Rights activists fought for change through established organizations such as the NAACP as well as new groups, such as an interracial local chapter of CORE.

The beginning of World War II in 1941 and the fast growth of the city's black population during the 1940s created new challenges. After a Baltimore City police officer shot and killed a black private from Pittsburgh, Civil Rights activists organized the 1942 March on Annapolis—the largest Civil Rights demonstration in the history of the state—and won important new changes. In 1943 (?), the election of  Republican Mayor Theodore McKeldin (after over a decade of leadership by Democratic Mayor Howard W. Jackson) provide African American leaders with a new ally after years of frustration.

Entering the 1950s, black Baltimoreans saw a wave of changes that prefigured the greater national changes coming at the national level between 1954 and 1968.

There are several important themes in this period:

- **Criminal Injustice**: hiring of black officers, ensuring a fair trial for black defendants, preventing and investigating police shootings, 1942 March on Annapolis
- **Education**: Continued response to the Strayer report to try to improve conditions at black schools; lawsuit against Baltimore County; and the move to begin limited desegregation.  
- **Public Accommodations**: Fight to open public parks and recreational facilities to black Baltimoreans and private businesses (restaurants, theaters, hotels) that served white but not black residents or visitors.
- **Housing**: Intense struggles over the location and public investment in public housing for African Americans and land use and transportation decisions in black neighborhoods

<!-- TODO: Revise the comments from Thompson and Cumberbatch below into a brief summary that describes how historians see this period as important. I need a copy of the Cumberbatch thesis! -->

Historian Prudence Denise Cumberbatch describes the period between 1929 and 1945 as of the "key social and political eras in the history of Baltimore".[@cumberbatch_working_2001] Cumberbatch highlights the internal debates within black Civil Rights movement leaders and organization over:

>whether or not their chances for success would be better if they formed alliances with radical political organizations, concentrated on intraracial campaigns, or placed their hopes in the policies of the federal government.

Cumberbatch concludes that, ultimately, African American activists in Baltimore incorporated all three strategies into their efforts to respond to the "immediate concerns of their community, be they mob violence or the treatment of workers in the steel mill."[@cumberbatch_working_2001] Bruce Thompson notes that in this period "Baltimore became a model for organizing blacks at the grassroots level to support the fight for black civil rights."[@thompson_civil_1996, 373]

### People/Organizations

- Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson
- Dr. John E.T. Camper
- Victorine Q. Adams
- Donald Murray
- Thurgood Marshall

<!-- TODO: This section is most effective when it serves as an introduction to patterns of changing leadership – who was making decisions and who wasn't and why? I'd like to make special mention of the role of plaintiffs in the legal fights organized by the NAACP (e.g. Louise Kerr, Donald Murray). The section on organizing under background could be moved up here. -->

### Places

The places associated with these events included those buildings created for use by African Americans under policies of segregation like Frederick Douglass High School (built 1924) or the Edgar Allan Poe Homes (built 1938). However, they also include places that served as sites of conflict in the fight against segregation such as Catonsville High School (built 1925) which is closely associated with the case of Williams v. Zimmerman (1937); the Enoch Pratt Free Library – Branch No. 1 (built 1886) where librarian Kerr was assigned to work after her success in the case of Kerr v. Pratt Library (1945); or the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, North Avenue and Calvert Street (built 1913) which began to desegregate on a limited basis in 1952. Private homes also served as important meeting places such as the Dr. John E.T. Camper House (built c. 1885) at 639 N. Carey Street or the Dr. Carl J. Murphy House in Morgan Park.

<!-- TODO: What about the new neighborhoods where African Americans residents moved "white flight" took hold in the late 1940s? What about sites of conflict such as Read's Drug Store or Ford's Theatre? I need to align these summaries with the categories described in the other Civil Rights heritage MPDF documents. -->

## Background

### Background on population changes

The growth of Baltimore's black population slowed during the Great Depression but grew quickly during and after World War II. The city's black population increased 60% over twenty years from 142,106 in 1930 to 225,099 in 1950. This change significantly outpaced the more modest 18% growth in the city's overall population. At the same time, African American residents went from 17.66% of of Baltimore City in 1930 to 23.70% of the population in 1950. Two major factors drove this change: the large number of African Americans moving to Baltimore during World War II seeking work in wartime industries and the growth of segregated white suburban communities in the surrounding counties. In Baltimore County, the population more than doubled from 124,565 in 1930 to 270,273 in 1950.

<!-- TODO: How did the black population of Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County change in this period? A regional analysis is essential to understanding how the city was changing. -->

<!-- TODO: Is it possible to find population data broken up by race and by City Council District to see how the growth of Baltimore's black population in this period changed the electoral politics of the city? -->

### Background on workers and the economy

 White unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor continued to exclude black workers. The loss of  and were subject to the policy of “last hired and first fired” leading to widespread job loss. In 1934, 13% of Baltimore whites and 40% of Baltimore blacks were on relief (?) according to a study by the Baltimore Urban League. While the federal government’s New Deal programs brought some relief, discrimination persisted even in the administration of these programs. The _Afro-American_ reported that an African American household with eight people recieved $8.94 a week for food but a white household of the same size recieved $12.70.[@farrar_baltimore_1998, 92-98]

<!-- TODO: I read something related to the Urban League that referenced the depression beginning for black people in Baltimore around 1926. I'm sure that would be a pattern found in other cities if it is accurate. -->

<!-- TODO: What proportion of black workers were employed in the service sector? How did employment opportunities vary by gender? Could this be a good place to talk about employment for blind or deaf workers? Or about black entrepreneurship? -->

### Background on organizing

<!-- TODO: How did the changes to organizing in Baltimore compare to other cities or national patterns of change in this period? -->

Despite the dramatic challenges African Americans in Baltimore faced during the Great Depression, the period was one of renewal and growth for the city's Civil Rights movement. In 1934, Thurgood Marshall began working for the local chapter of the NAACP and, in 1935, Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson took over as the president of the chapter. Jackson's leadership turned the local chapter from a struggling organization into one of the largest chapters in the country and, together with Thurgood Marshall and others, pioneered a strategy of legal attacks on segregated education that eventually led to the landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954). Jackson's daughter Juanita Jackson organized the City-Wide Young Peoples Forum beginning in 1931 (?) which inspired a broader  "Buy Where You Can Work" campaign protesting discriminatory hiring by businesses on Pennsylvania Avenue.

Thompson notes importance of secular leadership:

>The Baltimore movement between 1933 and 1942, however, was church supported, but not church led.[@thompson_civil_1996, 366]

Interracial organizations and white activists also played an important role in this period. The American Communist Party (established in 1919) expanded their advocacy for Civil Rights in Maryland during the 1930s and the ACLU of Maryland was founded on March 8, 1931, and Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) (founded in Chicago in March 1942) emerged in Baltimore in the early 1950s out of years of interracial organizing efforts.

>As two women who played large roles in the black rights movement later recalled, "there were always a few whites who braved the wrath and scorn and the ostracism to work" for civil rights.[@shoemaker_we_1994, 262]

Emergence of youth leadership

>In 1934, a mock Court of Social Justice held by the Baltimore Urban League and the City-Wide Young People's Forum asked Baltimore's black citizens to list the major problems they faced.[@thompson_civil_1996, 38]

>it was, according to Nannie H. Burroughs, "the best, most progressive, and analytical organization of Negro young people in America. It feels, thinks, believes, acts."[@thompson_civil_1996, 42]

See Genna Rae McNeil[@mcneil_youth_1995]

>Although several whites spoke at the Forum, the list of blacks speakers who addressed the Forum between 1931 and 1935 reads like a Who's Who of Black Americans. W. E. B. Du Bois, Walter White, Roy Wilkins, William Pickens, Charles H. Houston, and other civil rights leaders spoke at the Forum. So did Mary McLeod Bethune, Nannie H. Burroughs, E. Franklin Frazier, James Weldon Johnson, Sterling Brown, George Schuyler, Congressman Oscar DePriest, Carter G. Woodson, Reverend A. Clayton Powell, Sr., and other prominent black leaders.[@thompson_civil_1996, 51]

Among the City-Wide Young People's Forum:

>Race consciousness emerged as a major theme in the spring of 1932 after the lynching of a black man on Maryland’s Eastern Shore in December 1931.[@thompson_civil_1996, 52]

### Background on politics and Civil Rights

<!-- TODO: Should I look more closely at voting and barriers to voting in this period? Do we need to include some statewide context in addition to the situation in Baltimore? -->

Seeking to elect more Civil Rights supportive candidates to office, in 1943, the Baltimore chapter of the NAACP organized their first major Register-and-Vote campaign. On December 3, 1946, Victorine Adams held the first meeting of the Colored Women's Democratic Campaign Committee which led to the election of Harry A. Cole to the Maryland General Assembly, the first African American to serve in that role.

>According to the Reverend Marion Bascom of Douglas Memorial Community Church, McKeldin's accessibility allowed the early movement to be both effective and peaceful. "People didn't have to have a 'sit-in' demonstration to see Mr. McKeldin," observed Bascom. "Mr. McKeldin was avail- able and this, I think, made all the difference."[@shoemaker_we_1994, 262]

A growing acceptance of the need for change is also seen in the moves such as the Sunpapers of Baltimore dropping racial designation from news headlines in 1946

## Movement against police violence and criminal injustice

![Euel Lee being transported to Baltimore City jail, 1931. Photo courtesy Washington Area Spark/Flickr.](/civil-rights-heritage/images/1931-euel-lee-washingtonarea-spark.jpg)

<!-- TODO: This section is a bit of a mess right now. I'm not sure how to distinguish this from the prior 1905-1929 period except by the emphasis on the Euel Lee case and the 1942 March on Annapolis. Maybe that is enough? -->

Lynching and criminal injustice was at the center of black organizing and advocacy around Civil Rights and racial injustice in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Such cases highlighted the important role of the Communist Party in supporting African American Civil Rights as a strategy for build supporting among African Americans broadly.

On December 4, 1931, [Matthew Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Williams_(laborer)) was lynched at Salisbury, Maryland—as the Maryland Historical Society [underbelly blog](http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2012/11/29/an-american-tragedy/) notes:

> On December 4, 1931, Matthew Williams, an African American man, shot and killed his white employer in Salisbury and then turned the gun on himself in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. That evening, a mob of more than a thousand dragged Williams from his hospital bed where he lay critically wounded, and hung him up on the courthouse lawn. His body was then dragged to the town’s African American business district, and set on fire.  The Williams murder was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882, and the first since 1911.

On October 14, 1931, Euel Lee, known as “Orphan Jones”, was arrested for the murder of a white family reportedly over a disagreement about wages. The Maryland Communist Party took Lee’s case and lawyer [Bernard Ades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Ades) successfully moved Lee’s trial to Towson in Baltimore County. Ultimately, Ades lost the case (Lee was executed on October 28, 1933) but in the process helped to combat the informal prohibition on black jurors in Baltimore County.^[Citation missing!]

<!-- TODO: What is the broader significance of the Euel Lee case for jury selection and due process? -->

Two years later, on October 18, 1935:

> a mob of a thousand or more people stormed into the Princess Anne jail house and hauled Armwood from his cell down to the street below. Before he was hung from a tree some distance away, Armwood was dragged through the streets, beaten, stabbed, and had one ear hacked off.  Armwood’s lifeless body was then paraded through the town, finally ending up near the town’s courthouse, where the mob doused the corpse with gasoline and set it on fire.

In 1948, for the first time in the history of Maryland, a white man was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape of a black woman.

## Organizing black workers

<!-- TODO: There must have been more going on for black workers in this period than just the CIO. I think small business ownership should also be incorporated into this section. -->

Cumberbatch also argues that by working "with both the Fair Employment Practices Committee and the CIO, civil rights leaders were able to break through racial barriers that had historically confined African Americans to the least paying and least desirable jobs."[@cumberbatch_working_2001]

>Numbering 144,000 in a population of 817,000 in 1930,city blacks faced greater and different kinds of problems than whites. Substantial numbers were employed in 1930, but they occupied the lowest rung of the wage ladder. Indeed low wages for adult males had forced thousands of women, adolescents and the elderly on the job market to supplement meager family incomes. Eighty- five per cent of employable black males held jobs in 1930 compared to 77 percent of native whites, and 51 per cent of employable black women were wage earners, compared to 27 per cent of native whites.[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 19]

>Thus, the low-paying domestic service offered some 26,000 jobs to Baltimore blacks in 1930,but as conditions worsened, hundreds of white employers, determined to "take care of their own" first, preferred whites over blacks. As some city industries began to recover they employed whites rather than rehire blacks, and by 1936, seventeen percent of Baltimore's employable, skilled black males were out of work.[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 19]

>Conducting a survey of 115 retail and manufacturing firms in 1933, the Urban League discovered that blacks constituted 8.3 per cent of the firm's employees in 1933, compared to 9.2 per cent in 1930[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 19]

>City relief was distributed by the Family Welfare Association, which reported in 1934 that 40 per cent of the city's blacks, compared to 13 per cent of its whites, were on relief. The Urban League and a local association of the unemployed, studied 150 white and black relief cases in the same year and discovered that black families typically received smaller relief sums and were removed from relief rosters before whites.[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 19]

>In 1931 black longshore-men walked out of a meeting of the City Federation of Labor rather than accept Jim Crow seating. Local white unions occasionally violated or evaded even sacred commandments of labor. When black brick layers arrived in the city, union cards in hand, they were offered free train fare out of the city, not the traditional welcome of newcomers. Rather than work with black union hod-carriers,whites in the AF of L bricklayers' union used white scab labor.[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 20]

Ryon has much more on this overall topic but I don't think I need to pull in all of the block quotes I flagged with highlights:

>CIO locals were part of a powerful national movement (it became the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1938), and permanent headquarters for the Baltimore council were located in a large, three-story building in downtown Baltimore in April 1940[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 29] (Where was the CIO headquarters building?)

In the 1930s, African American activists put growing pressure on public and private employers to end segregated hiring and begin offering more opportunities to African American workers. This pressure included both a renewed legal efforts backed by the NAACP at the local and national level and a series of grass-roots protest actions organized by activist groups like CORE, inter-religious coalitions like the Baltimore Council of Churches, and by students (especially from Morgan State College). Another important supporter of reform were black professional organizations such as the Progressive Engineers Association of Maryland (organized in 1938) and the MeDeSo (a club for black physicians and dentists established by Dr. J.E.T. Camper and others in 1942).

An early sign of progress came in July 1937 when the Baltimore Police Department hired Violet Hill Whyte as the city's first black police officer. Whyte, however, was not a uniform officer and did not carry a gun as part of her work. In 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 which established Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) and lay a foundation for broader activism against discriminatory hiring. Such efforts were frustrated, however, by the weak support of many industrial unions for black workers and the racism of white workers. This challenge is exemplified in the example of Bethlehem Steel in 1943 (?) when white workers walked off the job in protest over the hiring of black workers.

Public workers had more success in the years after WWII than some private workers.
In 1945, the NAACP won a critical legal victory to end a segregated training program at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in the case of Kerr v. Enoch Pratt Free Library (1945).[@jackson_discrimination_2008; @herzog_kerr_2007] In 1953, the Baltimore City Fire Department appointed their first African American firemen. In 1949, the Baltimore City Medical Society, a local professional association for doctors, voted to admit African American members.

## Moving towards desegregation in education

On changes under Wood following the Strayer survey:

>Achievement gains were, in part, dependent upon improved school attendance. Under Wood‘s leadership, African American attendance rates improved steadily, and from 1929–1940, the attendance of African American elementary school students was above 85%. African American junior high school student‘s attendance from 1929–1940 was also above 85%.117 The attendance for African American high school students was above 90% for the same years as the elementary and junior high school students.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 44]

>Every year beginning from 1926–1942, Wood requested and received permission from the city school board to attend conferences held by the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. Following Carter G. Woodson‘s initiative, Wood introduced Negro History week each February in the schools to honor the history and achievements of African Americans. Each segregated school was responsible for creating and sponsoring their own Black History program.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 47]

>Wood, for example, was elected president of the Association for Colored School Teachers, which fought for better schools and equality.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 47]

>Wood warned African Americans that now was not the time to demand ―undue advantages.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 48] (Accomodationist?)

>On April 9, 1942, Carl Murphy, the chairman of the Baltimore Citizens Committee for Justice, sent Mayor Jackson a letter identifying the reasons why African American representation should exist on the Board of School Commissioners.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 50]

>The immediate response from the ―Commission on the Problems Affecting the Negro Population‖ was the hiring of more African American police officers and the appointment of the first black person to the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners, George F. W. McMechen, a 1895 graduate from Morgan College and a successful lawyer.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 51]

>Before 1935, blacks and the civil rights struggle were on the defensive, responding to segregation and the loss of rights. Starting in 1935, however, with the NAACP's legal campaign against educational inequalities, the civil rights struggle took the offensive (attacked and undermined legitimacy) against segregation.[@thompson_civil_1996, 4]

>On tire national level, the NAACP conducted a twenty-year (1935-1954) legal campaign against educational inequalities, which culminated in Brown v. Board o f Education o f Topeka.[@thompson_civil_1996, 7]
