## Introduction

The Great Depression began with the stock market crash in October 1929. For African Americans in Baltimore, the economic crisis meant widespread job loss and poverty. New Deal relief efforts through the Works Progress Administration and Public Works Administration reinforced the city's existing patterns of segregation and discrimination by using public money to tear down black "slum" housing and providing black families smaller relief payments than white families. The _Baltimore Afro-American_ observed in a 1933 editorial that "Baltimore is a border city with Southern feelings" reflecting on the persistent racism of many white residents and elected officials.[@thompson_civil_1996, 11] From the 1930s through the 1950s, African Americans in Baltimore, joined by some white supporters, organized and pursued a renewed campaign of protests fighting for equal employment and education at home in Baltimore and around the country.

The rapid growth of the city's black population during the 1940s following the beginning of World War II pushed the issues of housing and criminal injustice to the forefront alongside continuing efforts to expand opportunities for black workers. After a Baltimore City police officer shot and killed a black private from Pittsburgh, a coalition of local activists organized the 1942 March on Annapolis—the largest Civil Rights demonstration in the history of the state—and won important new changes. The election of  Republican Mayor Theodore McKeldin (after over a decade of leadership by Democratic Mayor Howard W. Jackson) provide African American leaders with a potential ally after years of frustration.

After the war ended in 1948, Baltimore saw a wave of major changes as African American residents, who had struggled under a severe housing shortage for decades, began buying homes in an expanding area of west Baltimore (west of Fulton Avenue) and in east Baltimore.  In 1951, Maryland legislature finally changed state laws requiring racial segregation on trains and boats and, by 1953, five years of protests by activists and students forced the desegregation of Ford's Theatre on Fayette Street in downtown Baltimore. On the eve of the monumental Supreme Court decision in _Brown v. Board of Education_, the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore had already started to radically transform life in the city.

Within this period, this study describes four key themes in detail:

- **Criminal Injustice**: Baltimore activists participated in national anti-lynching advocacy and fought police and mob violence in Baltimore. Activist efforts led to the city's first black uniformed police officers following the 1942 March on Annapolis
- **Employment and Education**: As the NAACP continued to campaign against segregated schools locally and nationally, black educators and administrators continued to build on the 1921 Strayer report to improve conditions for Baltimore's black students. Black workers also sought better conditions and to open more job opportunities to African Americans and found a partner in the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).
- **Public Accommodations**: White allies and African American students served as key supporters for activist efforts that opened public parks and recreational facilities, along with some (but not all) shops, restaurants, and theaters by the early 1950s.
- **Housing and Transportation**: A severe shortage of housing created difficult conditions for thousands of black Baltimoreans. This issue framed the struggle to build public housing for African Americans and pursue opportunities to purchase homes in formerly segregated white neighborhoods after WWII.

<!-- TODO: Revise the comments from Thompson and Cumberbatch below into a brief summary that describes how historians see this period as important. I need a copy of the Cumberbatch thesis! -->

The importance of this period is noted by historian Prudence Denise Cumberbatch who called the years betweeen 1929 and 1945 one of the "key social and political eras in the history of Baltimore".[@cumberbatch_working_2001] Bruce Thompson notes that in this period "Baltimore became a model for organizing blacks at the grassroots level to support the fight for black civil rights."[@thompson_civil_1996, 373] Cumberbatch highlights the importance of the internal debates within black Civil Rights movement as activists considered:

>whether or not their chances for success would be better if they formed alliances with radical political organizations, concentrated on intraracial campaigns, or placed their hopes in the policies of the federal government.

Cumberbatch concludes that, ultimately, African American activists in Baltimore incorporated all three strategies into their efforts to respond to the "immediate concerns of their community, be they mob violence or the treatment of workers in the steel mill."[@cumberbatch_working_2001] In contrast to the nineteenth century, this new movement relied on support from churches but largely followed secular leaders.[@thompson_civil_1996, 366]

The new leadership for activists in this period began in 1931 when Juanita Jackson organized the City-Wide Young Peoples Forum and hundreds of young people lent their support to a campaign ("Buy Where You Can Work") protesting the refusal of businesses on Pennsylvania Avenue to hire black workers. Bruce Thompson quotes Nannie H. Burroughs who called the group:

>the best, most progressive, and analytical organization of Negro young people in America. It feels, thinks, believes, acts.[@thompson_civil_1996, 42]

Thompson continues to note:

>Although several whites spoke at the Forum, the list of blacks speakers who addressed the Forum between 1931 and 1935 reads like a Who's Who of Black Americans. W. E. B. Du Bois, Walter White, Roy Wilkins, William Pickens, Charles H. Houston, and other civil rights leaders spoke at the Forum. So did Mary McLeod Bethune, Nannie H. Burroughs, E. Franklin Frazier, James Weldon Johnson, Sterling Brown, George Schuyler, Congressman Oscar DePriest, Carter G. Woodson, Reverend A. Clayton Powell, Sr., and other prominent black leaders.[@thompson_civil_1996, 51]

By 1934, Thurgood Marshall, a young lawyer, began working for the local chapter of the NAACP and, in 1935, Jaunita Jackson's mother Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson took over as the president of the chapter. The group had struggled with financial stability since its founding but Jackson transformed it into one of the largest chapters in the country.

White activists and interracial organizations reemerged as important allies in the 1930s and 1940s after the collapse of white support for Civil Rights in the late nineteenth century. The American Communist Party (established in 1919) expanded their advocacy for Civil Rights in Maryland during the 1930s. The ACLU of Maryland was founded on March 8, 1931. By the early 1950s, Baltimore had a local chapter of the interracial activist group the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) (founded in Chicago in March 1942). As two leading black activists later  recalled, "there were always a few whites who braved the wrath and scorn and the ostracism to work" for Civil Rights.[@shoemaker_we_1994, 262]

<!-- TODO: Should I look more closely at voting and barriers to voting in this period? Do we need to include some statewide context in addition to the situation in Baltimore? -->

Electoral politics also reemerged as a major source of opportunity as black voters around the country were key to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's reelection in 1936 and 1940. In 1934, Baltimore's black voters helped to defeat long-serving Democratic Maryland Governor Albert Ritchie in favor of Republican Harry Nice. In 1943, black voters helped to defeat the similarly long-serving Democratic Mayor Howard W. Jackson in favor of Republican Theodore McKeldin. The latter election followed the first major effort by the NAACP to organize a  Register-and-Vote campaign. <!-- FIXME: Double-check the timing on the NAACP register to vote campaign. --> Historian Shoemaker quotes Reverend Marion Bascom, a Civil Rights activist and leader of Douglas Memorial Community Church, remarking how as Mayor and later Governor Theodore McKeldin was accessible to activists:

>People didn't have to have a 'sit-in' demonstration to see Mr. McKeldin. Mr. McKeldin was available and this, I think, made all the difference.[@shoemaker_we_1994, 262]

Support for Nice and McKedin did not reverse the major realignment of black voters from the Republican to the Democratic Party. For example, on December 3, 1946, Victorine Adams held the first meeting of the Colored Women's Democratic Campaign Committee. In 1954, Adams' efforts led to the election of Harry A. Cole, the first African American to serve in the Maryland General Assembly.

The diversity of viewpoints and approaches is represented in the key activists from the 1930s to the early 1950s. Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson, Thurgood Marshall, and Dr. Carl Murphy who all worked closely with the local chapter and the national organization of the NAACP. Others important organizers and activists included Dr. John E.T. Camper (d. 1977) with the  Citizen's Committee for Justice and the Progressive Citizens of America (PCA); Victorine Q. Adams (1912–2006) with the Colored Democratic Women's Campaign Committee; and Edward Lewis with the Baltimore Urban League.

Others may not have served in formal leadership roles with Civil Rights organizations but supported the movement as plaintiffs; as workers integrating segregated institutions; and participants in the growing movement to use direct action. NAACP's legal campaigns in Baltimore relied on the courage and persistence of individual plaintiffs such as Margaret Williams	(b. 1923), Donald Gaines Murray (1914–1986), and Louise Kerr Hines (1916–2007). Others faced the challenge of being the first African American to integrate segregated institutions: Violet Hill Whyte (1897–1980) became Baltimore's first black nonuniformed police officer in 1937; Vivien Thomas (1910–1985) became one of the first black professional employees at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1941; Frederick I. Scott, Jr. (b. 1927) became one of the first black undergraduate students at Johns Hopkins University when he enrolled in 1945; and George Taliaferro became one of the first three black players for the Baltimore Colts football team in 1953.^[See more on the [history of African Americans at JHU](http://afam.nts.jhu.edu/people.html); see more on [Roland T. Smoot](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-01-27/news/0601270116_1_smoot-johns-hopkins-oral-history); [Taliaferro](http://cnsmaryland.org/2012/04/13/taliaferro-one-of-colts-first-black-players-recounts-times-in-baltimore/)] Finally, hundreds of people whose names are little-known today marched in picket lines on Pennsylvania Avenue in the early 1930s, walked miles to march on Annapolis in 1942, and sat down at lunch counters on Lexington Street in the early 1950s.

Changes to city and state politics and the noted renewal of activist organizations reflected the growth of the city's African American population in both size and proportion. The city's black population increased from 142,106 in 1930 to 225,099 in 1950—a 60% increase. This change significantly outpaced the more modest 18% growth in the city's overall population. African American residents went from 17.66% of Baltimore's population in 1930 to 23.70% in 1950. Two major factors drove this change: the large number of African Americans moving to Baltimore during World War II seeking work in wartime industries and the growth of segregated white suburban communities in the surrounding counties. In Baltimore County, the population more than doubled from 124,565 in 1930 to 270,273 in 1950—much of the growth coming from segregated white suburban communities. <!-- FIXME: How about the proportion of white to black residents in Balitmore County during this period? -->

The pattern of racial segregation in Baltimore continues to result in a concentration of places associated with the movement in historically segregated black neighborhoods. Examples include the MeDoSo Club House (the meeting place for a group of black doctors who donated generously to the NAACP) was located in a house at 1800 Eutaw Place and the segregated black Frederick Douglass High School (built in 1924) at 1601 N. Calhoun Street;  Edgar Allan Poe Homes (built 1938) and McCulloh Homes (built 1940)—two of the earliest public housing projects for African Americans. The residences of notable leaders were similarly in nearly all-black neighborhoods including the Dr. John E.T. Camper House (built c. 1885) at 639 N. Carey Street and the Dr. Carl J. Murphy House in Morgan Park.

However, the movement is also tied to places where activists fought against segregation including the former Catonsville High School (built 1925) which is closely associated with the case of Williams v. Zimmerman (1937); the Enoch Pratt Free Library – Branch No. 1 (built 1886) where Louise Kerr worked after successfully overturning a prohibition against black librarians in 1945; or the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (built 1913 – now the central office for the Baltimore City Public Schools) at North Avenue and Calvert Street which began to desegregate on a limited basis in 1952.

## Criminal Injustice

![Euel Lee being transported to Baltimore City jail, 1931. Photo courtesy Washington Area Spark/Flickr.](/civil-rights-heritage/images/1931-euel-lee-washingtonarea-spark.jpg)

<!-- TODO: This section is a bit of a mess right now. I'm not sure how to distinguish this from the prior 1905-1929 period except by the emphasis on the Euel Lee case and the 1942 March on Annapolis. Maybe that is enough? -->

Lynching and criminal injustice was at the center of black organizing and advocacy around Civil Rights and racial injustice in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Such cases highlighted the important role of the Communist Party in supporting African American Civil Rights as a strategy for build supporting among African Americans broadly.

On December 4, 1931, [Matthew Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Williams_(laborer)) was lynched at Salisbury, Maryland—as the Maryland Historical Society [underbelly blog](http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2012/11/29/an-american-tragedy/) notes:

> On December 4, 1931, Matthew Williams, an African American man, shot and killed his white employer in Salisbury and then turned the gun on himself in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. That evening, a mob of more than a thousand dragged Williams from his hospital bed where he lay critically wounded, and hung him up on the courthouse lawn. His body was then dragged to the town’s African American business district, and set on fire.  The Williams murder was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882, and the first since 1911.

On October 14, 1931, Euel Lee, known as “Orphan Jones”, was arrested for the murder of a white family reportedly over a disagreement about wages. The Maryland Communist Party took Lee’s case and lawyer [Bernard Ades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Ades) successfully moved Lee’s trial to Towson in Baltimore County. Ultimately, Ades lost the case (Lee was executed on October 28, 1933) but in the process helped to combat the informal prohibition on black jurors in Baltimore County.^[Citation missing!]

<!-- TODO: What is the broader significance of the Euel Lee case for jury selection and due process? -->

Two years later, on October 18, 1935:

> a mob of a thousand or more people stormed into the Princess Anne jail house and hauled Armwood from his cell down to the street below. Before he was hung from a tree some distance away, Armwood was dragged through the streets, beaten, stabbed, and had one ear hacked off.  Armwood’s lifeless body was then paraded through the town, finally ending up near the town’s courthouse, where the mob doused the corpse with gasoline and set it on fire.

In 1948, for the first time in the history of Maryland, a white man was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape of a black woman.

## Education and Employment

- School equality
- School desegregation
- Public relief for black workers and families
- Organizing black workers

### School equality

On changes under Wood following the Strayer survey:

>Achievement gains were, in part, dependent upon improved school attendance. Under Wood‘s leadership, African American attendance rates improved steadily, and from 1929–1940, the attendance of African American elementary school students was above 85%. African American junior high school student‘s attendance from 1929–1940 was also above 85%.117 The attendance for African American high school students was above 90% for the same years as the elementary and junior high school students.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 44]

>Every year beginning from 1926–1942, Wood requested and received permission from the city school board to attend conferences held by the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. Following Carter G. Woodson‘s initiative, Wood introduced Negro History week each February in the schools to honor the history and achievements of African Americans. Each segregated school was responsible for creating and sponsoring their own Black History program.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 47]

>Wood, for example, was elected president of the Association for Colored School Teachers, which fought for better schools and equality.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 47]

>Wood warned African Americans that now was not the time to demand ―undue advantages.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 48] (Accomodationist?)

>On April 9, 1942, Carl Murphy, the chairman of the Baltimore Citizens Committee for Justice, sent Mayor Jackson a letter identifying the reasons why African American representation should exist on the Board of School Commissioners.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 50]

>The immediate response from the ―Commission on the Problems Affecting the Negro Population‖ was the hiring of more African American police officers and the appointment of the first black person to the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners, George F. W. McMechen, a 1895 graduate from Morgan College and a successful lawyer.[@johnson_strayer_2012, 51]

>Before 1935, blacks and the civil rights struggle were on the defensive, responding to segregation and the loss of rights. Starting in 1935, however, with the NAACP's legal campaign against educational inequalities, the civil rights struggle took the offensive (attacked and undermined legitimacy) against segregation.[@thompson_civil_1996, 4]

>On tire national level, the NAACP conducted a twenty-year (1935-1954) legal campaign against educational inequalities, which culminated in Brown v. Board o f Education o f Topeka.[@thompson_civil_1996, 7]

In 1944, Baltimore City School board adds the first African-American member

### School desegregation

Working at both K-12 and college levels:

- Murray v. Pearson (1935)
- 1947, Dr. Ralph J. Young becomes first African American to join teaching staff at Johns Hopkins Hospital
- 1950, Frederick I. Scott becomes the first African American to graduate from Johns Hopkins University.
- 1950, Juanita Jackson Mitchell becomes the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Maryland Law School.
- 1951, Hiram Whittle becomes the first black undergraduate to enroll at the University of Maryland
- August 1, 1952, Polytechnic High School opened to African American students on a limited basis[@templeton_admission_1954]

See @seawright_desgregation_1970 on the Donald Murray Case.

### Public relief for black workers and families

 In 1934, 13% of Baltimore whites and 40% of Baltimore blacks were on relief (?) according to a study by the Baltimore Urban League. While the federal government’s New Deal programs brought some relief, discrimination persisted even in the administration of these programs. The _Afro-American_ reported that an African American household with eight people recieved $8.94 a week for food but a white household of the same size recieved $12.70.[@farrar_baltimore_1998, 92-98]

 <!-- TODO: I read something related to the Urban League that referenced the depression beginning for black people in Baltimore around 1926. I'm sure that would be a pattern found in other cities if it is accurate. -->

### Organizing black workers

White unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor continued to exclude black workers. The loss of  and were subject to the policy of “last hired and first fired” leading to widespread job loss.

<!-- TODO: What proportion of black workers were employed in the service sector? How did employment opportunities vary by gender? Could this be a good place to talk about employment for blind or deaf workers? Or about black entrepreneurship? -->

<!-- TODO: There must have been more going on for black workers in this period than just the CIO. I think small business ownership should also be incorporated into this section. -->

Cumberbatch also argues that by working "with both the Fair Employment Practices Committee and the CIO, civil rights leaders were able to break through racial barriers that had historically confined African Americans to the least paying and least desirable jobs."[@cumberbatch_working_2001]

>Numbering 144,000 in a population of 817,000 in 1930,city blacks faced greater and different kinds of problems than whites. Substantial numbers were employed in 1930, but they occupied the lowest rung of the wage ladder. Indeed low wages for adult males had forced thousands of women, adolescents and the elderly on the job market to supplement meager family incomes. Eighty- five per cent of employable black males held jobs in 1930 compared to 77 percent of native whites, and 51 per cent of employable black women were wage earners, compared to 27 per cent of native whites.[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 19]

>Thus, the low-paying domestic service offered some 26,000 jobs to Baltimore blacks in 1930,but as conditions worsened, hundreds of white employers, determined to "take care of their own" first, preferred whites over blacks. As some city industries began to recover they employed whites rather than rehire blacks, and by 1936, seventeen percent of Baltimore's employable, skilled black males were out of work.[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 19]

>Conducting a survey of 115 retail and manufacturing firms in 1933, the Urban League discovered that blacks constituted 8.3 per cent of the firm's employees in 1933, compared to 9.2 per cent in 1930[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 19]

>City relief was distributed by the Family Welfare Association, which reported in 1934 that 40 per cent of the city's blacks, compared to 13 per cent of its whites, were on relief. The Urban League and a local association of the unemployed, studied 150 white and black relief cases in the same year and discovered that black families typically received smaller relief sums and were removed from relief rosters before whites.[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 19]

>In 1931 black longshore-men walked out of a meeting of the City Federation of Labor rather than accept Jim Crow seating. Local white unions occasionally violated or evaded even sacred commandments of labor. When black brick layers arrived in the city, union cards in hand, they were offered free train fare out of the city, not the traditional welcome of newcomers. Rather than work with black union hod-carriers,whites in the AF of L bricklayers' union used white scab labor.[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 20]

Ryon has much more on this overall topic but I don't think I need to pull in all of the block quotes I flagged with highlights:

>CIO locals were part of a powerful national movement (it became the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1938), and permanent headquarters for the Baltimore council were located in a large, three-story building in downtown Baltimore in April 1940[@ryon_ambiguous_1980, 29] (Where was the CIO headquarters building?)

In the 1930s, African American activists put growing pressure on public and private employers to end segregated hiring and begin offering more opportunities to African American workers. This pressure included both a renewed legal efforts backed by the NAACP at the local and national level and a series of grass-roots protest actions organized by activist groups like CORE, inter-religious coalitions like the Baltimore Council of Churches, and by students (especially from Morgan State College). Another important supporter of reform were black professional organizations such as the Progressive Engineers Association of Maryland (organized in 1938) and the MeDeSo (a club for black physicians and dentists established by Dr. J.E.T. Camper and others in 1942).

An early sign of progress came in July 1937 when the Baltimore Police Department hired Violet Hill Whyte as the city's first black police officer. Whyte, however, was not a uniform officer and did not carry a gun as part of her work. In 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 which established Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) and lay a foundation for broader activism against discriminatory hiring. Such efforts were frustrated, however, by the weak support of many industrial unions for black workers and the racism of white workers. This challenge is exemplified in the example of Bethlehem Steel in 1943 (?) when white workers walked off the job in protest over the hiring of black workers.

Public workers had more success in the years after WWII than some private workers.
In 1945, the NAACP won a critical legal victory to end a segregated training program at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in the case of Kerr v. Enoch Pratt Free Library (1945).[@jackson_discrimination_2008; @herzog_kerr_2007] In 1953, the Baltimore City Fire Department appointed their first African American firemen. In 1949, the Baltimore City Medical Society, a local professional association for doctors, voted to admit African American members.

## Housing and Transportation

- Public housing
- Racial transition and "white flight"
- Transportation and land use

Early origins of the later fights over urban renewal and land use:

- July 15, 1949, Housing Act of 1949
- 1950, Baltimore City Council approves Public Housing Ordinance 1772
- Conversion/sale of park land for development

### Public housing

See @williams_living_1998 and @williams_politics_2004

### Racial transition and "white flight"

See Ed Orser - @orser_neither_1997 or @orser_blockbusting_1994

### Transportation and land use


### Transportation

- February 15, 1951, Maryland legislature ends segregation on trains and boats

Transportation also has major implications for housing and land use:

- Druid Lake Drive
- 1938, Construction of the Howard Street extension and bridge
- Proposal for Franklin Mulberry Expressway
- 1949, Converting Druid Hill Avenue into a one-way street (NAACP protests)

<!--  TODO: When was that big bridge and highway built through South Baltimore? I'm familiar mostly with the history in West Baltimore but much less in south Baltimore. -->

<!-- TODO: I'm not sure how to address black music, arts, and sports in this period:

-->

<!-- TODO: Here are things that I'm taking out:

On March 25, 1931, the [Scottsboro Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottsboro_Boys) were arrested and charged with rape in Scottsboro, Alabama — a case closely followed by the Afro-American newspaper.

>Juanita Jackson, a prominent local attorney and civil rights activist, and Clarence Mitchell, Jr., chief lobbyist of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1950 to 1978, captured the essence of this sentiment when they described the Baltimore of their youth as "a mean city."[@thompson_civil_1996, 11]

Emergence of youth leadership

>In 1934, a mock Court of Social Justice held by the Baltimore Urban League and the City-Wide Young People's Forum asked Baltimore's black citizens to list the major problems they faced.[@thompson_civil_1996, 38]

See Genna Rae McNeil[@mcneil_youth_1995]

Among the City-Wide Young People's Forum:

>Race consciousness emerged as a major theme in the spring of 1932 after the lynching of a black man on Maryland’s Eastern Shore in December 1931.[@thompson_civil_1996, 52]

 A growing acceptance of the need for change is also seen in the moves such as the Sunpapers of Baltimore dropping racial designation from news headlines in 1946.
