# Major Events

## Criminal injustice

Lynching and criminal injustice was at the center of black organizing and advocacy around Civil Rights and racial injustice in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Such cases highlighted the important role of the Communist Party in supporting African American Civil Rights as a strategy for build supporting among African Americans broadly.

On March 25, 1931, the [Scottsboro Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottsboro_Boys) were arrested and charged with rape in Scottsboro, Alabama — a case closely followed by the Afro-American newspaper. On December 4, 1931, [Matthew Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Williams_(laborer)) was lynched at Salisbury, Maryland—as the Maryland Historical Society [underbelly blog](http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2012/11/29/an-american-tragedy/) notes:

> On December 4, 1931, Matthew Williams, an African American man, shot and killed his white employer in Salisbury and then turned the gun on himself in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. That evening, a mob of more than a thousand dragged Williams from his hospital bed where he lay critically wounded, and hung him up on the courthouse lawn. His body was then dragged to the town’s African American business district, and set on fire.  The Williams murder was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882, and the first since 1911.

On October 14, 1931, Euel Lee, known as “Orphan Jones”, was arrested for the murder of a white family reportedly over a disagreement about wages. The Maryland Communist Party took Lee’s case and lawyer [Bernard Ades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Ades) successfully moved Lee’s trial to Towson in Baltimore County. Ultimately, Ades lost the case (Lee was executed on October 28, 1933) but in the process helped to combat the informal prohibition on black jurors in Baltimore County.

<!-- TODO: What is the citation for the above passage on Bernard Ades? -->

Two years later, on October 18, 1935:

> a mob of a thousand or more people stormed into the Princess Anne jail house and hauled Armwood from his cell down to the street below. Before he was hung from a tree some distance away, Armwood was dragged through the streets, beaten, stabbed, and had one ear hacked off.  Armwood’s lifeless body was then paraded through the town, finally ending up near the town’s courthouse, where the mob doused the corpse with gasoline and set it on fire.

In 1948, for the first time in the history of Maryland, a white man was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape of a black woman.
