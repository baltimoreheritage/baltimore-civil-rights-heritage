&lt;p&gt;Looking at the period 1910 to 1930, Dennis Doster used an expansive definition of “civil rights” that went beyond voting and holding political office, access to public education, and fair housing opportunities. His research considered “struggles for access to municipal and social services and struggles related to labor and employment.”&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;doster_strike_2015&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis Doster argues that some sholars who portray the era of the 1930s to 1950s as a kind of “golden age” of civil rights activism in the city and suggest that such activism was dormant prior to the early 1930s. Doster highlights the important role of less recognized organizations including the Federation of Parent-Teacher Clubs, the Women’s Cooperative Civic League, the Independent Republican League, and the Baltimore Urban League.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;doster_strike_2015&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doster also ties the national advocacy of the NAACP around residential segregation had roots in the fight over segregation in Baltimore.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;doster_strike_2015&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cumberbatch-not-done&quot;&gt;Cumberbatch (not done)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working For the Race: The Transformation of the Civil Rights Struggle identifies the period from 1929 to 1945 as one of the “key social and political eras in the history of Baltimore”&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;cumberbatch_working_2001&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumberbatch highlights the internal debates within black Civil Rights movement leaders and organization over:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whether or not their chances for success would be better if they formed alliances with radical political organizations, concentrated on intraracial campaigns, or placed their hopes in the policies of the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumberbatch concludes that, ultimately, African American activists in Baltimore incorporated all three strategies into their efforts to respond to the “immediate concerns of their community, be they mob violence or the treatment of workers in the steel mill.”&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;cumberbatch_working_2001&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumberbatch connects the “emergence of a youth movement” to “the resurgence of political activism among black Baltimoreans”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumberbatch also argues that by working “with both the Fair Employment Practices Committee and the CIO, civil rights leaders were able to break through racial barriers that had historically confined African Americans to the least paying and least desirable jobs.”&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;cumberbatch_working_2001&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn6&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref6&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes-from-an-ambiguous-legacy-baltimore-blacks-and-the-cio-1936-1941&quot;&gt;Notes from An Ambiguous Legacy: Baltimore Blacks and the CIO, 1936-1941&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbering 144,000in a population of 817,000in 1930,city blacks faced greater and different kinds of problems than whites. Substantial numbers were employed in 1930, but they occupied the lowest rung of the wage ladder. Indeed low wages for adult males had forced thousands of women, adolescents and the elderly on the job market to supplement meager family incomes. Eighty- five per cent of employable black males held jobs in 1930 compared to 77 percent of native whites, and 51 per cent of employable black women were wage earners, compared to 27 per cent of native whites.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn7&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref7&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the low-paying domestic service offered some 26,000jobs to Baltimore blacks in 1930,but as conditions worsened, hundreds of white employers, determined to “take care of their own” first, preferred whites over blacks. As some city industries began to recover they employed whites rather than rehire blacks, and by 1936, seventeen percent of Baltimore’s employable, skilled black males were out of work&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn8&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref8&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conducting a survey of 115 retail and manufacturing firms in 1933, the Urban League discovered that blacks constituted 8.3 per cent of the firm’s employees in 1933, compared to 9.2 per cent in 1930&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn9&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref9&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City relief was distributed by the Family Welfare Association, which reported in 1934 that 40 per cent of the city’s blacks, compared to 13 per cent of its whites, were on relief. The Urban League and a local association of the unemployed, studied 150 white and black relief cases in the same year and discovered that black families typically received smaller relief sums and were removed from relief rosters before whites.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn10&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref10&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The militant Knights of Labor and the IWW Wobblies had vigorously recruited blacks in the 1880’s and World War I eras, respectively, but by 1930most of the city’s locals were affiliates of the racist AmericanFederation of Labor&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn11&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref11&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1931 black longshore-men walked out of a meeting of the City Federation of Labor rather than accept Jim Crow seating. Local white unions occasionally violated or evaded even sacred commandments of labor. When black brick layers arrived in the city, union cards in hand, they were offered free train fare out of the city, not the traditional welcome of newcomers. Rather than work with black union hod-carriers,whites in the AF of L bricklayers’ union used white scab labor.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn12&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref12&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national Steelworkers Organizing Committee (SWOC) sent its first organizer to Baltimore in August 1936, and city SWOC helped form the first regional CIO council the next year. It assembled in Baltimore in November 1937 and mapped out plans to organize workers in every industry in&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn13&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref13&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A black steel worker was among the first CIO organizers in Baltimore&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn14&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref14&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIO militance was certainly to be put to test in Baltimore, for segregating blacks from whites in the factory was not just an old tradition, but an ongoing policy of divide and rule. When hundreds of black women had entered the clothing industry in the 1920’s, they were placed in the colored sections of the plants. Thriving and segregated company unions reminded whites of their higher social status.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn15&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref15&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1925 it had relied on white paternalism for jobs for blacks, but Edward Lewis, a young black activist who guided it after 1931, was committed to biracial unionism&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn16&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref16&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Who is Edward Lewis?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announcements about when to sign union cards and where street rallies would convene were unthinkable from the pulpits of a St. Leo’s or St. Stanislaus’ in white neighborhoods, but the doors of Drexel Baptist, Sharp Street A.M.E., and other black churches were thrown open to the CIO&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn17&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref17&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interdenominational Ministers’ Alliance&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn18&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref18&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its publishers were notoriously anti-union and even fired two blacks for joining the Newspaper Guild in 1938&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn19&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref19&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (About the Afro newspaper)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive to establish a CIO union at the Bethlehem Steel plants in nearby Sparrows Point was the most difficult, the longest (1936-1941), but the most successful CIO campaign. The largest employer of blacks in the urban area, Bethelhem used 5500 blacks of a total workforce of 16,500 in the very lowest paid jobs.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn20&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref20&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although blacks had day by day contact with whites, the Company accorded whites higher status by their “white only” lunch, bath, and locker room facilities&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn21&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref21&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United SugarRefining Workers,organizing at the large downtown Domino plants, appealed to five or six hundred blacks in a work force of about eight hundred and ousted the white only affiliate in 1938. Within a year its black president was sitting on the Maryland- D.C. CIO council.30&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn22&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref22&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Seventy-fifth Congress enacted the country’s first minimum wage law in 1938, small manufacturers in the city, unwilling to raise the wages of blacks, began lay-offs which were rumored to run in the hundreds.The Urban League convened a meeting in November to map out a city-wide protest boycott. It won the support of all the heads of civil rights organizations in the city and the Interdenominational Ministers Alliance. Black labor leaders endorsed the effort but among whites, only the president of the Amalgamated promised support; too few union members of either race were victims of the layoffs.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn23&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref23&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no national construction unions established to rival the powerful AF of L affiliate, the city CIO was willing to participate in the Urban League’s battle for black workers. Consequently, Edward Lewis established the Baltimore Building Trades Association which enrolled several hundred black craftsmen. Lewis persuaded the all white Bricklayers and the Cement- Workers to enroll a few blacks, but the Carpenters,who told Lewis that whites objected to sitting next to blacks at union meetings, were the toughest nut to crack. The League had a commitment to biracial unionism of CIO vintage, but with no CIO carpenters union available, what were the options? The Building Trades Association petitioned the AF of L Carpenters International for a separate, all-black local. The charter was awarded,and in the tradition of city longshore- men, new Local 544 enrolled dozens of black carpenters who soon won jobs at city housing projects&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn24&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref24&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIO locals were part of a powerful national movement (it became the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1938), and permanent headquarters for the Baltimore council were located in a large, three-story building in downtown Baltimore in April 1940&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn25&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref25&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Where was the CIO headquarters building?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in every six Baltimoreans was black, but only one in every eleven clothing workers, one in every twelve foremen in manufacturing, one in every nineteen masons or tile contractors,one in every thirty-seven clerks, one in every sixty-eight machinists,were black. By contrast, one in every two common laborers in steel was black, fifty per cent of the city’s male domestics were black, and seventy-five percent of its female domestics were black. Compiled fromU.S., Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Fifteenth Census of the United States, Population, IV, 667, 674-676.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn26&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref26&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By negotiating labor contracts which protected the jobs of senior employees, including blacks, the CIO saved the jobs of hundreds of employees of large industries. Perhaps as many as 20,000 city blacks were CIO members in 1940, but far fewer would have been eligible to join if the CIO had not reversed the “replace black with white”trend of the Depression years in the big industries. Yet by 1940 city blacks were still far more apt to be employed outside the large industries: thirty per cent of the non-white work force, compared to only one per cent of the white work force, were domestic service workers; thirty-seven per cent of white workers were industrial laborers compared to only nineteen per cent of black workers&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;ryon_ambiguous_1980&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn27&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref27&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the recommendations of the school survey led to monumental changes within the Baltimore City Division of Colored Schools between 1923 and 1943. … how school reform efforts provided African American educators with the necessary tools to improve the quality of education for African American students in the Baltimore City School System during legal segregation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltimore City Public School Directory from 1906–1951, an excellent source, provided the names of all the teachers and principals of the Baltimore City School System from 1906–1951.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn29&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref29&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1872, the Centenary Bible Institute began holding classes at 44 East Saratoga Street in Baltimore City, where, in 1878, John H. Griffin became the first person of color to graduate from the Institute. Crowded conditions soon forced the Institute to relocate, and in 1881 it did to the corner of Edmondson and Fulton Avenues.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn30&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref30&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Add the 44 E. Saratoga Street location for the Centenary Bible Institute to the inventory!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Association next opened an elementary school for African Americans in Baltimore in the African Baptist Church at the corner of Calvert and Saratoga Streets in 1865.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn31&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref31&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the black community demanded reforms, which, despite resistance, resulted in the Colored High School in 1882 at Holliday and Lexington Streets.17&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn32&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref32&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1888, Baltimore City School officials appointed Roberta B. Sheridan as the first African American teacher in city schools.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn33&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref33&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1888 Sheridan began teaching at School no. 9 at Carrolton and Riggs Avenue in West Baltimore.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn34&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref34&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1898, James H. Van Sickel, a school reformer from Denver, was appointed Superintendent of the Baltimore City Public Schools.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn35&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref35&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notably, there was a new policy of hiring African American teachers and administrators, namely principals and vice principals.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn36&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref36&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 1902– 1903 school year, for example, there were over 10,000 students and 166 teachers in the eighteen segregated black schools of Baltimore City. African Americans solely staffed the following schools: School no. 103, 105, 107,112, 113, 114, 115, 116, and 118.20 Never the less, Schools no. 100, 101, 105, 106, 111, and 118 still had white male and female teachers teaching African Americans in 1903.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn37&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref37&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by 1907 there was not one white teacher teaching in Baltimore City Division of Colored Schools.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn38&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref38&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in 1900, there were eighteen schools designated for African American children, and many of them had been constructed before the Civil War.25 For example, School no. 116 at Druid Hill Avenue near Biddle Street was erected in 1842; School no. 109 at Fremont and King Streets was constructed in 1843; and School no. 101 at Jefferson Street near Caroline Street was built in 1855.26&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn39&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref39&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, several schools in Baltimore City that were set aside for African Americans were erected after the Civil War; they were School no. 105 at Roger Avenue near Lexington Street in 1874, School no. 106 at Hill and Sharp Streets in 1893, and School no. 101 located at Mount and Saratoga Streets in 1896.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn40&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref40&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James H. N. Waring, principal of the Colored High and Manual Training School&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn41&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref41&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the state level, for example, the Maryland State Teachers Association campaigned in 1915 for an extended school term for colored schools.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn42&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref42&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the school reform efforts were slow, the segregated schools of Baltimore City did benefit from the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 with the expansion of home economics and vocational classes.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn43&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref43&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the editors of the Baltimore Afro-American Newspaper demanded Charles Koch, the superintendent of schools, to hire an African American superintendent. Hayward Farrar cites Koch‘s response: ― ̳Blacks were not far enough developed to have a school board member, but would do well as members of the street cleaning force.“&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn44&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref44&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems of the Baltimore School System were not hidden: overcrowded schools, inadequate facilities, poor school curriculum, and out dated management practices.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn45&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref45&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey recommended that all trade and apprentice programs be opened up to African Americans, especially since 1910 they were in almost all of the various occupations in the city.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn46&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref46&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This potential inaction was a blow to the African American community, which was not only supportive of the school survey, but also excited about its recommendations. African Americans, who had been excluded from housing, social, and school reform efforts throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, believed that the Strayer report would provide a real opportunity for the segregated schools to participate in much needed school reform&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn47&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref47&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Francis Russell as the Director of the Baltimore City Division of Colored Schools&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn48&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref48&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 1, 1925, Francis Marion Wood was appointed supervisor of all African American schools of Baltimore City; he would stay in the position until 1943, overseeing many changes.105 With a starting salary of $4200 per school year, Wood relocated to Baltimore with his wife Nellie and their four children. Wood‘s position included the responsibility for implementing and overseeing the recommendations of the Strayer Report. Supervisor Wood reported to David Weglein, who was Superintendent of Public Instructions and who reported to the nine members of the Board of School Commissioners, the Mayor, and the Baltimore City Council.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn49&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref49&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achievement gains were, in part, dependent upon improved school attendance. Under Wood‘s leadership, African American attendance rates improved steadily, and from 1929–1940, the attendance of African American elementary school students was above 85%. African American junior high school student‘s attendance from 1929–1940 was also above 85%.117 The attendance for African American high school students was above 90% for the same years as the elementary and junior high school students.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn50&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref50&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year beginning from 1926–1942, Wood requested and received permission from the city school board to attend conferences held by the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. Following Carter G. Woodson‘s initiative, Wood introduced Negro History week each February in the schools to honor the history and achievements of African Americans. Each segregated school was responsible for creating and sponsoring their own Black History program.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn51&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref51&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood, for example, was elected president of the Association for Colored School Teachers, which fought for better schools and equality.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn52&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref52&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood warned African Americans that now was not the time to demand ―undue advantages.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn53&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref53&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Accomodationist?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 9, 1942, Carl Murphy, the chairman of the Baltimore Citizens Committee for Justice, sent Mayor Jackson a letter identifying the reasons why African American representation should exist on the Board of School Commissioners.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn54&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref54&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immediate response from the ―Commission on the Problems Affecting the Negro Population‖ was the hiring of more African American police officers and the appointment of the first black person to the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners, George F. W. McMechen, a 1895 graduate from Morgan College and a successful lawyer.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;johnson_strayer_2012&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn55&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref55&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not until 1898 that women began to form independent organizations to assist in defraying the newly acquired $70,000 debt for the new edifice. … Gaining a sense of autonomy, they began to assert themselves in their community and nation by participating in the Women‘s Club Movement and the Progressive Movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the report describes the various social, religious, and educational purposes of the Sharp Street Community House, a church-affiliated community center that housed young and poverty stricken.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;jamison_leading_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn56&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref56&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;women, and offered professional classes to the Baltimore black community. The House aimed to ―provide a higher civic and social life, to institute and maintain educational and philanthropic enterprises and to investigate and improve conditions generally through co-operation with other social agencies.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;jamison_leading_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn57&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref57&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look up Black Neighbors: Race and Limits of Reform in the American Settlement House Movement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;―the club movement among black women owed its very existence to the groundwork of organizational skill and leadership training gained through women‘s church societies.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;jamison_leading_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn58&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref58&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the article, Cynthia Neverdon-Morton provides a brief history of the Colored Empty Stocking and Fresh Air Circle, a society that was organized to help Baltimore‘s dependent children after the destructive city fire of 1904.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;jamison_leading_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn59&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref59&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodson‘s history is one of the first that analyzes the various secular uses of the Negro church. It served as school, forum in which to debate national and local issues, and welfare agency.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;jamison_leading_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn60&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref60&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the church has been the centre and heart of Negro life in antebellum days, and even since the Civil War has it largely continued to represent the streams of racial activity, and hence a history of the Negro race is an essential and worthy matter.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;jamison_leading_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn61&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref61&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;61&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second Annual Reunion and Convention of Women Engaged in Christian Work&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;jamison_leading_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn62&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref62&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look up the Confederation of Women of Baltimore City&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the leadership of Reverend M. J. Naylor, the church began a community program in 1919 that included a kindergarten, a day nursery, and an employment bureau.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;jamison_leading_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn63&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref63&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Neverdon-Morton asserts, early 20th century African-American women took an interdenominational approach to uplifting their race. Church women throughout Baltimore, regardless of class or level of education, worked together in a number of social and charitable organizations to better their community.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;jamison_leading_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn64&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref64&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.M. Carroll chapter and the Mercy and Help Department of Sharp Street Church‘s Epworth League.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;jamison_leading_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn65&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref65&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1910 the N.M. Carroll chapter opened a coffee shop and soup house in the Windsor Flats section of Baltimore.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;jamison_leading_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn66&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref66&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1913 Ross became the president of the Day Nursery Association, a community based organization that cared for the children of Baltimore City working mothers. Ross frequently organized fund raisers and social events to benefit the organization.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;jamison_leading_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn67&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref67&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many turn-of-the-century African-American women across the nation, the women of Sharp Street Church noticed the many needs in their community and sought to fulfill them. When their church was in need of funds to defray the cost of the new edifice, the women established organizations whose principal objective was to persistently raise funds until the debt was paid. After witnessing the lack of proper healthcare and the substandard living conditions of African Americans in Baltimore, the women organized church events to meet the economic as well as social needs of their community.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;jamison_leading_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn68&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref68&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi Plan of 1890 helped to instigate a new racial policy in the South by providing a model by which southern states could disenfranchise blacks.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn69&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref69&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 1890 and 1910, every state below the Border South (Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri) found ways to disenfranchise their black populations.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn70&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref70&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 1895 and 1915, blacks developed two competing philosophies in response to their new status as segregated second-class citizens. Booker T. Washington dominated the period with his educational theory and social philosophy known as the “Atlanta Compromise.”&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn71&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref71&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;71&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For W. E. B. Du Bois, accommodation and uplift would not solve the problems blacks faced. He advocated the more radical position that blacks should oppose segregation and work for their political and civil rights.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn72&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref72&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;72&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Supreme Court decisions outlawed grandfather clauses (Guinn v. United States in 1915), residential segregation ordinances (Buchanan v. Warley in 1917), mob trials (Moore v. Dempsey in 1923), and white primaries (Nixon v. Herndon in 1927). These were important victories for the civil rights struggle because they showed that blacks could respond to segregation and the abridgement of rights and helped set the stage for the civil rights movement.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn73&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref73&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;73&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 1935, blacks and the civil rights struggle were on the defensive, responding to segregation and the loss of rights. Starting in 1935, however, with the NAACP’s legal campaign against educational inequalities, the civil rights struggle took the offensive (attacked and undermined legitimacy) against segregation.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn74&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref74&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;74&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On tire national level, the NAACP conducted a twenty-year (1935-1954) legal campaign against educational inequalities, which culminated in Brown v. Board o f Education o f Topeka.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn75&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref75&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Baltimore is a border city with Southern feelings,” proclaimed the Baltimore Afro-American in a 1933 editorial.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn76&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref76&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;76&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juanita Jackson, a prominent local attorney and civil rights activist, and Clarence Mitchell, Jr., chief lobbyist of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1950 to 1978, captured the essence of this sentiment when they described the Baltimore of their youth as “a mean city.”&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn77&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref77&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;77&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Marshall, “The only thing different between the South and Baltimore was trolley cars. They weren’t segregated. Everything else was segregated.”&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn78&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref78&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The black community in Northwest Baltimore would not expand significantly, however, because Baltimore’s government leaders used two discreet strategies—clearance and containment—to remove slums and keep blacks confined in the Northwest district.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn79&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref79&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enfranchised blacks offered 40,000 potential votes, and black leaders believed they could parley those votes into support on the following key issues: equal status on common carriers, allowing blacks to testify in court against whites, permitting black lawyers to practice in Maryland state courts, the aforementioned school issues, allowing blacks to serve on juries, and applying all laws, including the Bastardy Act, equally to blacks and whites.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn80&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref80&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Johnson stated, “there must be Negro lawyers, men who have themselves suffered and who will fight the people’s fight, because the people’s fight will be their own battles!”&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn81&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref81&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 1885 and 1905, the Brotherhood handled several cases involving black civil rights. Two of the more famous were the Navassa Island case and the Berry Picker case from Somerset County.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn82&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref82&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law was used to defend black civil rights against encroachments by whites. Never did the Brotherhood initiate proceedings to strengthen, re-establish, or expand black civil rights.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn83&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref83&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;83&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the places that did accommodate blacks separated them from the white patrons. For example, the Peabody Institute had separate galleries for its black audiences.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn84&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref84&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;84&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 1904 and 1918, however, blacks in Baltimore were able to limit the spread of segregation in three areas: transportation, suffrage, and residential housing.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn85&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref85&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1904, Maryland’s General Assembly passed a law, as part of Gorman’s Jim Crow campaign, requiring segregation on all railroads. The law was extended in 1908 to include electric lines and steamboats.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn86&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref86&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;86&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black opposition managed to garner an exemption for travel within Baltimore, but outside the city limits all blacks suffered the ignominy of being separated.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn87&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref87&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test case of the transportation ordinance in 1920 by Hawkins upheld the practice of segregation, and the law remained on the books until 1951.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn88&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref88&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1910, even the Republican Party was openly segregating blacks at Party functions.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn89&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref89&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1900, blacks comprised fifteen percent of the voting-age population and fifteen percent of the registered voters. By 1932, blacks comprised sixteen percent of the voting-age population, but only twelve percent of the registered voters. Only in a few wards did the black vote make a difference in local elections. In 1931, four wards had a black majority and three others were evenly populated by blacks and whites.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn90&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref90&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City Council passed the second segregation ordinance, repealed it one month later on technical grounds, and then repassed it with amendments. This third segregation ordinance was signed into law on May 15, 1911, as Mahool’s last official act as mayor.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn91&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref91&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;91&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A suitable challenge to this ordinance took two years to emerge, but in 1913 W. Ashbie Hawkins defended John E. Gurry for moving into an all-white block.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn92&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref92&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;92&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baltimore’s City Council had passed a fourth segregation ordinance one week before the third ordinance was ruled unconstitutional by Maryland’s Court of Appeals in 1913. This fourth ordinance overcame the constitutional objections by making the law applicable only to future sales or rentals. People owning property at the time the fourth ordinance was passed could occupy their residences, no matter where they were located. In 1915, Hawkins defended Thomas S. Jackson for violating this latest ordinance. After losing in the lower court, Hawkins was prepared to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn93&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref93&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months later black Baltimoreans rejoiced again when the Maryland Court of Appeals overturned Baltimore’s fourth segregation ordinance in Jackson v. State. In writing its opinion, the court concluded: “It is thus definitely settled, upon highest authority, that the right of the individual citizen to acquire or use property can not be validly restricted, by State or municipality, on the ground of his color.”49&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn94&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref94&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;94&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1934, a mock Court of Social Justice held by the Baltimore Urban League and the City-Wide Young People’s Forum asked Baltimore’s black citizens to list the major problems they faced.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn95&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref95&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City-Wide Young People’s Forum asked Baltimore’s black citizens to list the major problems they faced.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn96&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref96&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;96&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was, according to Nannie H. Burroughs, “the best, most progressive, and analytical organization of Negro young people in America. It feels, thinks, believes, acts.”&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn97&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref97&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

John Hope Franklin and Genna Rae McNeil (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1995),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although several whites spoke at the Forum, the list of blacks speakers who addressed the Forum between 1931 and 1935 reads like a Who’s Who of Black Americans. W. E. B. Du Bois, Walter White, Roy Wilkins, William Pickens, Charles H. Houston, and other civil rights leaders spoke at the Forum. So did Mary McLeod Bethune, Nannie H. Burroughs, E. Franklin Frazier, James Weldon Johnson, Sterling Brown, George Schuyler, Congressman Oscar DePriest, Carter G. Woodson, Reverend A. Clayton Powell, Sr., and other prominent black leaders.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn98&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref98&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;98&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Race consciousness emerged as a major theme in the spring of 1932 after the lynching of a black man on Maryland’s Eastern Shore in December 1931.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn99&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref99&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baltimore movement between 1933 and 1942, however, was church supported, but not church led.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn100&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref100&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baltimore City Council finally ended legalized segregation in public accommodations in 1962. A state referendum on open accommodations passed in Maryland in 1964, despite failing on the Eastern Shore, much of Western Maryland, and in Baltimore and Anne Arundel counties.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn101&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref101&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;101&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Baltimore became a model for organizing blacks at the grassroots level to support the fight for black civil rights.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;thompson_civil_1996&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn102&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref102&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;102&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As two women who played large roles in the black rights movement later recalled, “there were always a few whites who braved the wrath and scorn and the ostracism to work” for civil rights.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;shoemaker_we_1994&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn103&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref103&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;103&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Reverend Marion Bascom of Douglas Memorial Community Church, McKeldin’s accessibility allowed the early movement to be both effective and peaceful. “People didn’t have to have a ‘sit-in’ demonstration to see Mr. McKeldin,” observed Bascom. “Mr. McKeldin was avail- able and this, I think, made all the difference.”&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;shoemaker_we_1994&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn104&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref104&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;104&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late February, 1964, the NAACP also had a large hand in the passage of the Baltimore City Public Accommodations and Fair Employment Practice Ordinances, which guaranteed an end to lawful dis- crimination in “employment practices, educational institutions, places of public accommodation, resort or amusement, and health and welfare agencies.”&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;shoemaker_we_1994&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn105&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref105&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;105&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As a resource for anyone who might be interested in retracing our steps, we are publishing a copy of our notes here with plans to expand this post into a resource on how we’re approaching our school outreach this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;south-baltimore-civil-rights-walking-tour&quot;&gt;South Baltimore Civil Rights Walking Tour&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around 1-2 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around 1.5 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; These notes were prepared by Eli Pousson for Baltimore Heritage to lead a 2015 November 20 walking tour for students from Digital Harbor High School in South Baltimore. The map for this tour is available in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/baltimoreheritage/baltimore-geojson/blob/master/digital-harbor-hs-south-baltimore-tour.geojson&quot;&gt;Baltimore Heritage collection of GeoJSON map data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;southern-high-school-site&quot;&gt;Southern High School Site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1910: Souther High School built as the first of a new type; organizing grades seven, eight and nine together, then known as the “junior high school” (later reorganized and known as “middle schools” by the 1980s) and had a co-ed student body with both boys and girls for the first time in Baltimore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1926: Addition facing Warren Avenue at the intersection with Riverside Avenue built&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Originally located on the southeast corner of Warren Avenue and William Street, the building was constructed of brick with limestone trim in a Jacobean/English Tudor style architecture used for a number of Baltimore City and other American schools of that era.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1955: school had an enrollment of 1,800 students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1956: $2 million expansion project designed to accommodate 600 additional students completed; added eight more regular classrooms, a double classroom, five new art rooms, eight commercial classrooms for typing and business machines, three music rooms, a three shops for machine, print and auto mechanic instruction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When was the building demolished?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On resistance to desegregation at Southern High School&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 1, 1954, 500 white students gathered outside Southern High School protesting school integration with signs including “We Want Southern Back” and “Negroes Not Allowed.” After some of the 39 black students enrolled at the school are attacked, police intervene and arrest several white protestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On violence and housing segregation in South Baltimore:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 8, 1910, as the city wrestled  the Baltimore Sun published an article under the loud headline, “THEY BLOCKED INVASION / Residents Of Locust Point Quickly Solved Negro Problem. BY FORCE AND MORAL SUASION / Young Men Of Southeast Baltimore Always Ready To Protect The Female Sex From Discourtesies,” continuing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time passed negroes moved into Sharp street, in Southwest Baltimore, and some began to work in developing Locust Point water front. Some families evidenced a desire to live near their work. They were told by some of the Locust Point white men that if they moved into that section they would also die near their work. The white men meant it, the negroes realized it, and it is doubtful if there is a negro family in all Locust Point. On evening about six years ago a negro family moved into a house in Locust Point. The furniture arrived at 6 o’clock. At midnight the house was a total wreck. The doors had been torn from their hinges and the window frames smashed. At 7 o’clock the next morning the negroes had left. They never came back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Locust Point example illustrates the violence frequently used to enforce the boundaries of racially segregated housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;churchill-street-alley-houses---federal-hill&quot;&gt;Churchill Street Alley Houses - Federal Hill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time in early 1978 only a few blocks of the Federal Hill National Register district were in the process of being renovated—the 200 block of E. Montgomery Street and the 200 block of Churchill, the 800 block of William Street, and the 200 and 300 blocks of Warren Avenue—all addresses with harbor views of adjacent to Federal Hill Park. Some blocks south, Struever Bros. &amp;amp; Eccles had recently rehabbed four houses on the north side of E. Cross Street and four to the north along Grindall Street—with a community courtyard in between. A number of blocks at the north end of Federal Hill—parts of the east and west unit blocks of Montgomery Street, and the unit block of E. Hughes Street stood desolately vacant behind tall chain link fences. Houses in the 800 block of S. Charles Street were burned out shells and the 700 and 800 blocks of S. Hanover Street were also boarded and vacant. The houses on Montgomery Street, acquired by the city when plans were still afoot to stretch an expressway across the oldest part of Fells Point via a bridge over the harbor to the oldest parts of Federal Hill, sat empty after the defeat of “The Road” while HCD decided what to do with them. Eventually, these houses would be auctioned off to the highest bidders who could guarantee they had the money and expertise to renovate them. But in the meantime, they proved a gold mine of information to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher Phillips described the condition and location of free black housing in early 19th century Baltimore, writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the decades following 1810 a perceptible shift of residential patterns for thousands of free blacks occurred in Baltimore. As the commercial core of the city became an area made up almost exclusively of affluent white families, black and white laborers were pushed toward the periphery of the city. Although as late as 1810 nearly half of the city’s free Negroes lived in the central wards, by 1830 less than 10 percent resided in that part of the city. The largest number moved to the western precincts, where developers had responded to the population boom by laying out new streets and erecting cheap tenement housing. The rest of the city’s displaced free blacks relocated east of the commercial core, either across from Jones’ Falls in Old Town, an area of the city where most were craftspeople and laborers, or into the narrow streets and alleys in and around Fells Point, where older, cheaper housing was merging with new row-house construction.&lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-cites=&quot;phillips_freedoms_1997&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillips continued to note the concentration of black Baltimoreans along alleys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many cities in the Deep South, where high walls enclosed yards containing slave quarters (thus often precluding the incorporation of alleys into the municipal design), Baltimore had a maze of alleyways and court-yards in which most of the city’s free blacks soon came to make their homes. […] In 1820 such places as Happy Alley, Argyle Alley, Strawberry Alley, Petticoat Alley, Apple Alley in or near Fells Point; Union Alley and Liberty Alley in Old Town; Bottle Alley, Whiskey Alley, and Brandy Alley in the core city; and Welcome Alley, Waggon Alley, Dutch Alley, Sugar Alley, and Honey Alley just to the west of the central city and to the south of it in the Federal Hill area were lined with small row houses in which multiple free black and slave families lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this concentration, the city was not wholly segregated, as Phillips noted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While alleys early on became predominantly black areas of residence in Baltimore, the city as a whole did not so quickly exhibit such segregation. […] As in other southern cities, no legal segregation existed in antebellum Baltimore, and all residential streets (and even the alleys) had black family dwellings interspersed with those of laboring and poor whites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;montgomery-street-houses&quot;&gt;Montgomery Street Houses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that most of what became the neighborhood of Federal Hill once belonged to John Eager Howard, Revolutionary War hero and later Governor of Maryland, who first divided the land into lots and laid out streets in 1782. The frame house at 130 E. Montgomery Street was built in 1796 by Matthew Murray, a boatman or mariner; the fine brick house at 36 E. Montgomery, probably the oldest surviving brick house in Federal Hill, went up in 1795, built by a Philadelphia house carpenter named John Fisher. The two-and-a-half-story brick houses at 1-11 E. Montgomery—all undergoing renovation in 1978—were built in the first few years of the nineteenth century. Ford Barnes, a carter, built the three-bay-wide house at 9 E. Montgomery for himself in 1801 and the adjoining two-bay-wide house at 11 E. Montgomery for rental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ebenezer-ame-church&quot;&gt;Ebenezer AME Church&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the oldest standing church built by an African American congregation, dating to 1865. It stands on the site of an earlier church building erected in 1848 by the same congregation, which may have formed as early as 1816. Several outstanding clergymen served the church, including Bishop Daniel A. Payne, who founded the nationâs oldest African American university.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year 1836, a group of worshipers met in a small paint shop in South Baltimore for the purpose of singing and praying. This group was the first membership of what is now known as Ebenezer A.M.E. Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present property was purchased in 1839, but the church was not incorporated until 1848. The church has undergone many structural changes since its beginnings, but the love and support of the members have remained constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven of Ebenezer’s pastors were ordained bishops in the African Methodist Church.  They were Daniel Payne, A.W. Wayman, Joseph A. Shorter, John M. Brown, James Campbell, James A. Hardy and Isaac N. Ross.  Bishop Payne, who organized Ebenezer and served briefly as the pastor, became one of the leading educators of his time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebenezer also played an important part in the education of black children. In 1839, the church took pride in operating a day school on the premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ebenezer’s English Gothic design, its stained glass windows with geometric Victorian patterns, its pews and ceiling beams of Georgia pine, its marble pulpit and its electrified Bronze bell - which can be used to signal us to worship - are all representative of the sacrifices and accomplishments of dedicated, loyal and supportive people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1838, a “Watch Meeting” under Methodist principles was held in a carpenter’s shop on the corner of Sharp and Little Hughes streets. In 1838, the Methodist congregation purchased the shop and renamed it John Wesley Chapel in honor of the founder of the Methodist denomination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public School #126 was designed by J.J. Husband of Avery &amp;amp; Husband who created the prototypical models for grammar and primary schools for Baltimore. This school served the African American residents of South Baltimore in the neighborhood now known as Sharp Leadenhall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Historic Leadenhall Baptist Church is an old established church located in Baltimore, Maryland. Baltimore is the 19th largest city in the United States with a population of approximately 630,000. Located in South Baltimore, the church was established in 1872 with the cornerstone laid on July 15, 1872 and the dedication held on May 12, 1873. The church is nestled between Baltimore’s two major stadiums and sits on prime real estate south of Baltimore’s famous harbor in the Sharp-Leadenhall Community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp-Leadenhall is an up and coming neighborhood surrounded on all sides by expensive property with the Otterbein neighborhood to the north, and the Federal Hill neighborhood to the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church was organized with a total membership of eight under the name of Leadenhall Street Baptist Church by African-American Baptists of the Sharp-Leadenhall area with the help of the Maryland Baptist Union Association. It is the second oldest church building in Baltimore continuously occupied by the same African-American congregation and one of the earliest settlements of free African-Americans in the city. By 1874, the membership had grown to 146. The congregation is predominantly African American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church was designed and built by Joseph B. Thomas and Son, who owned and operated a planning mill on Leadenhall Street near Montgomery Street. Thomas, a Baptist, manufactured moldings, pews, pulpits, altar rails, Gothic windows, etc. from the 1860’s through the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 27, 1887, a meeting was held to draw up the church’s charter to establish, by government standards, Leadenhall as a Christian place of worship with a governing body to administer the duties. The meeting included the pastor, the trustees, and selected church members. The charter was officially completed and sealed by the City of Baltimore on November 26, 1883. In attendance at the signing of the charter were the pastor, Reverend Ananias Brown, and five trustees. They were Levin I. Hughes, Richard H. Freeman, Richard Harris, Lawrence Carrington, and Oscar Bowen. One of the six original members, Richard H. Freeman has descendants who still attend the church. This makes the Freeman family one of the oldest families in attendance at Leadenhall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update – January 6, 2015:&lt;/strong&gt; We have moved the study of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue to &lt;a href=&quot;/civil-rights-heritage/places/1232-druid-hill-avenue/&quot;&gt;a separate page&lt;/a&gt;. The previous version of this draft that described the property as the Joseph C. Briscoe House incorrectly confused Joseph Briscoe (b. 1873, Maryland) a waiter who lived at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue with &lt;a href=&quot;/civil-rights-heritage/people/joseph-cornelius-briscoe/&quot;&gt;Joseph C. Briscoe&lt;/a&gt; (b. 1883, North Carolina) who served as a noted educator and educational administrator. We have updated the title of the post and our identification of the house to reflect the association with Abraham Briscoe and his family—not Joseph C. Briscoe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Baltimore Heritage</name><email>info@baltimoreheritage.org</email></author><summary type="html">We are working on a study of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue in response to the recent demolition of the Freedom House at 1234 Druid Hill Avenue.

At &lt;a href=&quot;http://baltimoreheritage.org/&quot;&gt;Baltimore Heritage&lt;/a&gt;, we are passionate about trying out new ways to make our work accessible, engaging and useful. We created this site (using an open-source tool known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;) to openly share our writing, research notes, and other resources as we put together a historic context and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/nrb16b/&quot;&gt;National Register multiple property designation form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, when we are working to nominate a building to the National Register of Historic Places, we don’t share anything until the nomination is nearly complete. A single nomination can involve months of solitary research and writing. When the draft is complete, we seek out revisions and comments from neighborhood residents, scholars, and Maryland Historical Trust staff before the nomination is finalized and sent on to the National Park Service for review. For this project, we wanted to try something different — an experiment with &lt;strong&gt;“Open Notebook History”&lt;/strong&gt; where anyone at all can look over our shoulder and share their thoughts on what we’re writing from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the material we publish here won’t be perfect. We think the risk of making any public errors or embarrassing omissions are outweighed the benefits of opening up this effort for more people to learn, share and help shape the collection of research and documentation we are building. For more on the issues and advantages of this approach, be sure to read historian W. Caleb McDaniel’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html&quot;&gt;2013 post on Open Notebook History&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve already published &lt;a href=&quot;/civil-rights-heritage/historiography&quot;&gt;a historiography&lt;/a&gt; first drafted in early June and &lt;a href=&quot;/civil-rights-heritage/educational-resources&quot;&gt;a resource guide&lt;/a&gt; for teachers and families. In the next few weeks, we plan to share essays summarizing our research on the themes of housing and criminal injustice.
