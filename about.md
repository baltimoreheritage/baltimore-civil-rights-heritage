## Overview
Baltimore’s Civil Rights Heritage: Looking for Landmarks from the Movement is an ongoing project to research and document the historic context for the long Civil Rights movement for African Americans in Baltimore. Our goal is to complete a National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property Documentation Form formally recognizing the significance of this history and supporting the designation and preservation of local Civil Rights landmarks in the future. During the course of the project, we are using this site to share our working documents and related resources. We hope you can explore the site and share your own ideas, comments, questions and suggestions.

## Project Partners
- Baltimore Heritage
- Baltimore National Heritage Area
- Maryland Historical Trust
- Baltimore City Public Schools

## How is this project funded?
Funding for this project is provided by the National Park Service through the new Heritage Initiative grant program funded through the Historic Preservation Fund to explore the ways in which the legacy of underrepresented groups can be recognized, preserved and interpreted for future generations. Additional funding is provided by the Preservation Maryland Heritage Fund grant program.

## What is the National Register of Historic Places?
The National Register of Historic Places is the official list of the Nation's historic places worthy of preservation. Authorized under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, it is part of a national program to coordinate and support public and private efforts to identify, evaluate, and protect our historic and archeological resources. The National Register is administered by the National Park Service under the Secretary of the Interior.

## What is a Multiple Property Documentation Form?
The National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property Documentation Form (NPS 10-900-b) nominate **groups of related significant properties**. Within the form, the themes, trends, and patterns of history shared by the properties are organized into historic contexts. Individual types of properties that represent those historic contexts are defined.

The Multiple Property Documentation Form is a cover document and not a nomination in its own right, but serves as a basis for evaluating the National Register eligibility of related properties.
