# 1831 – 1870

The earliest school for African Americans in Baltimore began in 1797 when the Maryland Society for the Abolition of Slavery, a Quaker abolitionist group, opened the Baltimore African Academy for the children of free black parents. In 1826, the General Assembly of Maryland authorized the creation of the Baltimore City school system for white children under the age of ten and the first school, known as Public School No. 1, opened on September 21, 1829. Public Schools No. 2 and 3 opened soon after and by the end of the year, 269 students were enrolled. Recognizing the injustice of being forced to pay school taxes that supported only white schools, Africans American leaders in Baltimore petitioned the city government to provide either tax relief or schools for black children in 1839, 1844, and 1850. In each case, the Mayor and City Council rejected the petitions, despite the 1850 petition having signatures from 90 black and 126 white Baltimore residents.

Overall, less than one-third of all children in Baltimore attended school and one-third of students attended private or religious schools. The 12,000 children enrolled in Baltimore’s public schools in 1854 were largely middle-class white Protestants. Most black children who attended school went to Sabbath schools organized by black churches, or white Methodist, Presbyterian or Quaker schools. In 1859, African Americans established the Colored Sabbath School Union of Baltimore formed to improve black education and support poor children to attend private schools. In 1864, a group of thirty white businessmen, lawyers and ministers (mostly Quakers) formed the Baltimore Association for the Moral and Educational Improvement of Colored People with the goal of establishing a black public school system. Within a year, the group had established seven schools in Baltimore with 3,000 students enrolled. At their peak in 1867, the group had set up more than 100 schools in Baltimore and on the Eastern Shore.[@baum_brown_2011, 25-26]
