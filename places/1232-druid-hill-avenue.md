# Significance Summary: 1232 Druid Hill Avenue

The Abraham Briscoe/George W. King House at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue is a three-story rowhouse erected around 1867 or 1868. 1232 Druid Hill Avenue is one of many large rowhouses erected in the area now known as the Upton neighborhood during a period of rapid growth and development in Baltimore’s northwestern suburbs both before and after the end of the U.S. Civil War. George W. King, a prominent local printer, lived at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue from 1887 up until his death in 1898. King had previously lived at 272 Druid Hill Avenue (1883-1886), 378 N. Eden St. (1872-1878), 197 N. Exeter (1868), and 37 N. Exeter (c. 1858 - mid-1860s). His move to Druid Hill Avenue exemplified King’s continued professional success further evidenced by his role as one of 25 printers who organized the Association of Employing Printers in 1877, and, a few years later, the Typographical Union. 

In the late 1890s and early 1900s, the population of the Druid Hill Avenue and many adjoining streets changed as many white residents left the area and African American households rented or purchased homes in the vicinity of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue. In 1899, George King’s son, George W. King rented the house to Abraham Briscoe, an African American wagon driver, and his family. Born in 1856, Briscoe was one of thousands of black Baltimoreans who migrated to the city from Southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore in the years after the Civil War. Abraham’s brothers, Joseph and John, and his children belonged to a generation of African Americans born after the end of slavery in Maryland in 1864. Like many others, they (or their parents) came to the city seeking both economic opportunity and freedom from the oppressive violence and poverty affecting black communities in Maryland. The opportunities the Briscoe family and their neighbors found in Baltimore in the late 19th century, while still limited by discrimination and segregation, provided a foundation for civic activism and organizing that helped to improve their communities. For example, the “Misses Briscoes” volunteered for the “Fresh Air and Empty Stocking Circle” chaired by educator and activist Ida Cummings who lived at the neighboring 1234 Druid Hill Avenue.

The movement of African Americans to Baltimore and the important role of black Civil Rights activism grew quickly during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Throughout this period ,the neighborhood offered homes to working class black Baltimoreans moving to the city from rural Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina to rented apartments at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue and nearby rowhouses. Men working as chauffeurs, waiters and laborers and women working as secretaries, domestics, and laundresses played a critical role in shaping the history of West Baltimore and the city as the whole, making 1232 Druid Hill Avenue a significant reminder of the Great Migration and Baltimore’s Civil Rights history before World War II.

Acquired by Bethel AME Church in 1981, the building has fallen into disuse in recent years. Regrettably, the 2015 demolition of 1234 Druid Hill Avenue, known as the “Freedom House”, and scores of other rowhouses within the Old West Baltimore Historic District over the past 20 years highlights the importance of preserving 1232 Druid Hill Avenue and the important history of early 20th century African American community in West Baltimore.

# Property History: 1232 Druid Hill Avenue

Please note: Prior to the 1887 renumbering of Baltimore’s street addresses, house numbers on the east side of Druid Hill Avenue between Dolphin and Lanvale Streets ranged from 240 to 274. 272 Druid Hill Avenue was renumbered 1232 Druid Hill Avenue.

## 1867-1868: 272 Druid Hill Avenue erected by Rufus Bennett

The history of the house at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue, erected by local builder Rufus Bennett between 1867 and 1868, reflects Baltimore’s broad patterns of suburban growth in the years after the Civil War. Beginning in 1859, new horsecar lines provided the transportation required to connect suburban enclaves with the city’s fast-growing commercial and industrial enterprises. This new infrastructure, combined with Baltimore’s growing population and wealth, encouraged new suburban development—often centered around new parks, like Franklin Square and Eutaw Place.

Druid Hill Park, established in 1860, reflected both the city’s interest in promoting development in northwest Baltimore and the need to protect some open space from prospective development. Following the end of the U.S. Civil War in 1865, the northwestern suburbs grew quickly. In just four years, between 1866 and 1870, building permits nearly tripled from 1,384 to 3,630.[^1] While many of these homes were primarily marketed towards wealthy buyers or investors, changes in homebuilding—notably innovative approaches to manufacturing better and cheaper bricks and the increasing use of prefabricated wooden elements for cornices and embellishments—helped to keep the cost within a range that a growing number of middle class Baltimoreans could afford.

On April 1, 1864, Baltimore Mayor John Lee Chapman approved an ordinance changing the name of Ross Street between Eutaw Street and North Avenue to Druid Hill Avenue. On August 30, 1867, the _Sun_ reported on “Dwelling Improvements in the Western Section,” writing:

> On Madison avenue, McCulloh street, Druid Hill avenue, Davidson street, McMechin and other streets, handsome dwellings are rapidly going up on lots which were but a few years ago open fields. Rufus Bennett, builder and owner, has **just finished six on Druid Hill avenue**, which are regarded as most stylish residences. On McMechin street, near the avenue, the same builder has five more in an advanced stage of completion, whilst **three at Druid Hill avenue and Lanvale street** and two at Lafayette square are under roof, under his superintendence.

On November 13, 1867, a classified appeared in the _Sun_ advertising the Druid Hill Avenue houses for sale:

> FOR SALE—One of those five new HOUSES on Druid Hill avenue, between Dolphin and Lanvale streets, just finished in the best manner, running back to a 16 foot paved alley. Apply to GEO. T. GOSNELL, on the premises.

Subsequent classified advertisements published in the _Sun_ in May 1868 list additional homes for sale on the east side of Druid Hill Avenue and, on September 11, 1868, the _Sun_ ran an advertisement stating:

> For Sale—Three of those beautiful HOUSES on Druid Hill avenue, near Lanvale street, containing all modern conveniences and built out of the very best materials. Apply to the owners, HUBMER & WEBER ...

These accounts support a date of construction for 1232 Druid Hill Avenue and the adjoining Italiante rowhouses between summer 1867 and spring 1868. The new homes in 1867 are closely followed by the opening of new streets as the Baltimore City Commissioner's Office moved on November 27, 1867 to open Lanvale Street, noted in the _Sun_:

> Upon application to establish the lines and grade of Lanvale street, between Druid Hill avenue and Division street, notice is hereby given that the City Commissioner and Surveyor will meet on the premises on WEDNESDAY, the 4th of December, at 10 o'clock A.M., for that purpose. By order, GEO. P. WOODWARD Clerk to the City Commissioner

Builder Rufus Bennett had a long and active career in Baltimore beginning as an apprentice around 1841 and continuing up through the late 19th century. The _Sun_ commented on his death on July 22, 1906, writing:

> Mr. Rufus Bennett, one of the oldest residents of the city and for years prominent in business circles, died at 6 A.M. yesterday at his home, 520 West Biddle street. General debility was the cause of his death.
> Born in Carroll county, near Waters Mill, 82 years ago, Mr. Bennett was the son of the late William Bennett. He acquired his education at the public schools in the county and, when 17 years old, came to this city to learn a trade. He apprenticed himself with a contractor and builder and, about 55 years ago, opened an office for himself.

## 1870-1883: Early Residents at 272 Druid Hill Avenue

During the 1870s and early 1880s, the property on Druid Hill Avenue saw a variety of residents. The first resident in this period is James Foos, a bricklayer listed as a resident in the 1870 Woods’ Baltimore City Directory. It is possible that Foos took ownership of the house as payment for work with Rufus Bennett in constructing the row. [More on Foos](http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/MD-BaltimoreCity/2005-09/1126119764)

In 1871, the [Woods’ Directory](https://archive.org/stream/woodsbaltimoreci1871balt/woodsbaltimoreci1871balt%5C_djvu.txt) lists two residents at 272 Druid Hill Avenue:

- William R. Robertson, tailor
- William Robinson, candymaker

Between 1872 and 1877, according to the Wood’s Baltimore City Directory (1872, 1873, 1875 and 1877), Francis A. Benson, employee of the firm J. Fussell & Co. lived at 272 Druid Hill Avenue. Beginning in 1875, the household included Albert C. Stabell. Stable is initially identified as an employee of J. Fussell & Co. and, in [1877](https://archive.org/stream/woodsbaltimoreci1877balt/woodsbaltimoreci1877balt%5C_djvu.txt), as a dealer in ice cream and country produce with an office at the Saratoga Building on Saratoga Street near Calvert Street.

On May 12, 1877, the house appeared for sale in a _Sun_ classified advertisement:

> FOR SALE—A strictly first-class HOUSE, No. 272 Druid Hill avenue, (next to the corner of Lanvale street,) containing 18 rooms, built out of the best material, hard wood finish, in complete order. Inquire, between 12 and 2 o'clock, of J. HUBNER, next door.

In 1878, residents in [Woods’ Baltimore City Directory](https://archive.org/stream/woodsbaltimoreci1878balt/woodsbaltimoreci1878balt%5C_djvu.txt) at 272 Druid Hill Avenue included:

- Charles King, grocer, shop at Eutaw and Lexington Streets
- Mcllvain King, grain commission merchant, office at 23 South Street
- William P. King, clerk
- J.H. Mcllvain King, clerk

The King household did not remain on Druid Hill Avenue long. On September 14, 1878, an advertisement appeared in the _Sun_ advertising an auction by F.W. Bennett & Co. auctioneers scheduled for September 19 of "FURNITURE, CARPETS, ETC., of a private family declining housekeeping.” Items up for auction included:

> Elegant WALNUT and EBONY PARLORSUITS, in good order…

By 1880, [Woods’ Baltimore City Directory](https://archive.org/stream/woodsbaltimoreci1880balt/woodsbaltimoreci1880balt_djvu.txt) listed a new set of residents at 272 Druid Hill Avenue:

- Carroll B. Mount, clerk
- Thomas L. Mount, agent
- Mrs. Laura M. Starr

On April 27, 1882, a classified in the _Sun_ advertised the property for sale:

> FOR SALE—No. 272 DRUID HILL AVENUE, near Lanvale Street 20 feet front, first-class in every particular. Will sell cheap. Apply on premises.

## 1883: George W. King moves to 1232 Druid Hill Avenue

In 1883, the [Woods’ City Directory](https://archive.org/stream/woodsbaltimoreci1883balt/woodsbaltimoreci1883balt_djvu.txt) lists George King, a prominent local printer, as a resident for the first time including two others:

- William B. Gibson, telegraphist 
- Alberts King, clerk 
- George W. King, King Brothers

During his residence at the house, King evidently engaged in speculative development and renting houses within the neighborhood. On July 31, 1883, a classified appeared in the _Sun_  advertising a house nearby:

> For Rent—583 DRUID HILL AVENUE, new and complete in modern improvements. Rent very reasonable. Apply at 272 DRUID HILL AVE. or 162 W. BALTIMORE ST., up stairs.

King also rented and repeatedly tried to sell a property at 2118 Druid Hill Avenue.  The _Baltimore Sun_  published a classified advertisement on Feb 4, 1887:

> 2118 Druid Hill Avenue, 10 rooms, large parlor, dry cellar, nice yard. Apply 1232 DRUID HILL AVENUE.

King advertised his property at 2118 Druid Hill Avenue for sale on May 16, 1891 with the description, “cable road passes door; rents for $25.” Evidently finding no buyers, King continued to advertise the property for rent on October 8, 1896.

Around this same time, the row house next door to George King’s home, 1234 Druid Hill Avenue, sold and the owners converted the home into a boarding house. 1234 Druid Hill Avenue is advertised on August 15, 1888 as a “FIRST-CLASS DWELLING”:

> Three-story DWELLING, front and rear, No. 1234 Druid Hill avenue, corner Lanvale street, 20 feet 6 inches front; all modern conveniences.
> JOHN GLENN & CO., 12 St. Paul street.

A subsequent classified advertisement appearing in the _Sun_ on April 9, 1890 advertised rooms for rent:

> COMMUNICATING AND SINGLE ROOMS, with BOARD, also TABLE BOARD
> No 1234 DRUID HILL AVENUE, corner Lanvale st.

George W. King died at his home on Druid Hill Avenue in early November 1898. Additional background on George King and the King Brothers Printing Firm is included in the following section of this report on the Contextual History of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue.

## 1899: Briscoe family moves to 1232 Druid Hill Avenue

After King’s death in 1898, his family moved to rent the house on Druid Hill Avenue. Abraham Briscoe moved with his family from their home at 1419 Maryland Avenue to 1232 Druid Hill Avenue – making the Briscoe household one of many African Americans moving away from more central neighborhoods into a growing African American community in northwest Baltimore.[^2] Based on his last name, Abraham Briscoe is likely a descendant of enslaved people held in St. Mary’s County by members of the Briscoe family – possibly the Sotterley Plantation held by Dr. Walter Hanson Stone Briscoe among a number of possible locations. Briscoe is originally [a Scottish name](https://www.houseofnames.com/briscoe-family-crest) brought to Maryland by several European colonists during the 1600s. Given his age in 1900, Abraham may have himself been born into slavery.

Abraham shared his household with his two brothers both waiters born after the end of the Civil War:

- Joseph Briscoe (b. 1873) 
- John Briscoe (b. 1870)
	 
The 1900 Federal Census recorded Abraham’s own occupation as a “Wagon Driver.” Despite their working class associations, these skilled trades placed the Briscoe family in a relatively privileged position reflected their ability to move to 1232 Druid Hill Avenue. In homes with fewer wage-earning adults, tenants or home owners often brought in boarders to help cover the cost of the rent  or mortgage. For example, on August 5, 1899, the Afro published a notice from Mrs. E. J. Cummings, wife of Councilman Harry S. Cummings, advertising "Boarding and Lodging" at 1234 Druid Hill Avenue.  

1232 Druid Hill Avenue also offered the Briscoe household the opportunity to host and entertain friends and relatives. On January 10, 1903, the _Afro-American_ published an account of “A New Year's Eve Reception” at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue:

> Messrs Joseph Briscoe and Columbus Ramsey entertained many of their friends at dinner, Wednesday evening, December 31st, at the former's residence 1232 Druid Hill Ave. The dining and drawing rooms were artistically decorated with holly, evergreen and smilax, while large potted plants completed the decoration. The Menu which was nicely prepared but more nicely consumed, consisted of oysters on the shell, bouillon, turkey stuffed with chestnuts, Smithfield ham, hominy on chafing, individual ices and beverages to the course. At the stroke of twelve the guest knelt down in silent prayer which was lead by Mr. Abram Briscoe.

On February 14, 1903, the _Afro_ observed:

> A very delightful tea was given last Sunday evening by the Misses Briscoe at their residence, 1232 Druid Hill Ave.

The Briscoe family was related to Ella B. Morris who lived at 524 Laurens Street as early as 1904. According to a _Sun_ report on December 17, 1900, Abraham Briscoe was a founding member of the "Ancient United Order Sons and Daughters, Brothers and Sisters of Moses," (an African American fraternal and civic organization) along with James M. Seward, Solomon A. Bond, John W. Henson, Louis H. Davenport, Andrew E. Bolden, Andrew A. Spriggs, Dennis Hall, John H. Bailey, James Harris and Andrew Johnson. Abraham’s relatives Mrs. Ella B. Morris and Pinkney Briscoe were also involved in the Order of Moses, as the _Afro American_ noted her on October 22, 1904:

> Mrs. Ella B. Morris, of 524 Laurens street, returned home last week after an extended trip in the mountains. She left the city again last week, in company with her brother, Mr. Pinkney Briscoe, to attend the annual convention of the Order of Moses which is in session in Brooklyn, N.Y.

Two years later, Morris returned to New York with Abraham as the _Afro American_ reported on October 13, 1906:

> Mrs. Ella B. Morris and Mr. Abraham Briscoe are delegates to the Annual encampment of the Order of Moses, which meets in Troy, N.Y., next week.

Established in 1868, the United Order of Moses had chapters in cities throughout the country based in Baltimore at 527 Orchard Street. Fraternal organization provided economic support for their members (typically in the form of insurance) and often played a critical role in supporting Civil Rights activist efforts.

Living next door to Ida R. Cummings, daughter of Harry S. Cummings and resident at 1324 Druid Hill Avenue, encouraged members of the Briscoe family to help raise funds for youth programs. The _Afro American_ published an account of “Summer Work of the Fresh Air and Empty Stocking Circle” by Miss Ida R. Cummings, President, and Mrs. Mamie R. Bruce, Secretary, on November 3, 1906, noting:

> Among the latest contributions received were $5.45 from a Lawn Party given by the Misses Briscoe's Druid Hill avenue.

By 1909, according to a city directory of that year, Abraham and Harriet Briscoe had moved to 524 Laurens Street (an address previously noted as the home of Mrs. Ella B. Morris) along with Ernest Briscoe (employed as a porter). Robert L. Briscoe employed as a butler lived close by at 535 Laurens Street. Harriet Briscoe died at 524 Laurens Street on October 14, 1910. Abraham Briscoe remained at that address through at least 1918.

## 1909: 1232 Druid Hill Avenue subdivided into apartments

The Briscoe household appears to be the first black family to live in 1232 Druid Hill Avenue and the last single-family household to occupy the property before George King converted the building into three apartments. The conversion of the building into apartments around 1909 reflects the continuing changes in the neighborhood as a growing number of working-class African Americans sought and found housing in West Baltimore. 

By October 4, 1908, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue was up for sale, advertised under “Real Estate for Sale” in the _Baltimore Sun_: 

> ONLY $1,000.00 FOR 816 N. BOND ST., $2,500 for 1232 DRUID HILL AVE., $1,350 for 559 LAURENS ST.; Houses, small and large, in every section of the city for sale on very easy terms. C. MORTON, 209 St. Paul street.

Evidently, the 1908 sale attempt proved unsuccessful as George W. King Jr. retained ownership through at least 1912. On May 20, 1912, a second advertisement for the property appeared in the _Sun_:

> FOR SALE—DWELLING 1232 DRUID HILL AVE. Apply GEORGE W. KING / 31 South Howard street.

Around this same time Mrs. Mollie Giles, the recently widowed wife of [Darius Giles](http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=52869211) (b. 1861 – d. 1908 June 4) moved into the building. On April 16, 1910, the _Afro-American_ reported:

> Mrs. Mollie Giles has moved from 1619 Druid Hill avenue to 1232 Druid Hill avenue.

In 1910, the Census recorded:

- [Fill this in!] …

On June 1, 1912 , the _Afro-American_ reported again on Mrs. Molly Giles:

> Mrs. Mollie Giles, who left for Asbury Park, N.J. Tuesday, was tendered a reception at her home, 1232 Druid Hill avenue, Monday night. A number of the members of Brown's Circle, an organization of ladies with which Mrs. Giles is connected were also present. Miss Ella Sutton, of 1234 Druid Hill avenue, accompanied Mrs. Giles.

Her return to Baltimore at the end of the summer was similarly noted. Other residents in this period included Mrs. Harriett Swann, whose family appeared in the _Afro-American_ on January 9, 1915:

> William Swann, of the United States Navy, is visiting relatives at 1232 Druid Hill avenue.

The next year, on May 27, 1916, the _Afro-American_ reported:

> Mr. and Mrs. Woods have returned home after spending a fortnight with Mrs. Woods' mother, Mrs. Harriett Swann at her home 1232 Druid Hill avenue.

On August 9, 1912, the property was advertised for sale in the _Afro-American_:

> In Fee—400 E. 25th, 1213 W. Lexington near Franklin Square; also 1232 Druid Hill ave., 609 N. Calhoun, opposite Harlem Square. CHARLES MORTON, 209 St. Paul St.

Not all of the residents in the 1910s and 1920s received coverage from the _Afro_ society pages. Some women at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue advertised in the _Sun_ under “Situation Wanted—Female” seeking work. For example, on March 27, 1909, a resident listed an advertisement:

> LAUNDRESS WANTS LAUNDRY WORK; finery specialty; housecleaning by day; can give references. 1232 DRUID HILL AVE.

This advertisement may have been placed by Nellie Peaker, a resident of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue in 1913, whose occupation was listed in the city directory of that year as a dressmaker. By 1920, the federal census records 13 people living in three apartments:

- Harry Schaefer, Head (b. 1894, North Carolina), Laborer, Steel Works
- Casper Cyrus, Boarder (b. 1894, Virginia), Porter, YMCA
- Birdie Cyrus, Boarder (b. 1885, Maryland)
- Viola Cyrus, Boarder (b. 1906, Maryland)
- Juenette Laws, Boarder  (b. 1901, Virginia), Office Girl, Doctor’s Office
- Vira Laws (b. 1897 , Virginia), Waitress, Club

- [Fill in information for the second and third apartments…]

On January 29, 1923, another resident sought work with an advertisement under “Situations—Male,” stating:

> CHAUFFEUR, first-class, wishes position with private family; 3 years' reference from last employer. 1232 Druid Hill ave.

On September 1, 1923, a young woman, perhaps then 17-year-old Viola Cyrus,  advertised under “Under Situations—Female,” noting:

> GIRL (colored), place Cook or Chambermaid; stay nights. 1232 DRUID HILL AVE.

On September 11, 1923, another resident advertised under “Situations—Female,” noting:

> A VERY intelligent colored High School Girl wishes job in private family of the school. Apply 1232 DRUID HILL AVE. First Floor.

African Americans in Baltimore, broadly excluded from employment opportunities in Baltimore’s growing industrial sector, faced particular challenges around poverty and criminal injustice. In addition, the violence common in all of Baltimore’s working class communities could also be found in the neighborhood of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue. For example, on September 12, 1909, the _Baltimore Sun_ reported under the headline “Three Shot in "Fuss" Over Woman,” writing:

> As the result of a pistol affray, Charles Coates, 429 Tyson street; Margaret Coates and Charles Clemens, 1232 Druid Hill avenue, colored were all slightly wounded yesterday morning at the house, 1232 Druid Hill avenue, and the two men were committed by Justice Tyson, at the Northwestern Police Station, on the charge of assaulting and shooting each other. The shooting occurred at about 9.15 o'clock in the morning and was concerning the woman. Clemens was shot in the left arm, Margaret Coates in the hand and Charles Coates in the hip.

Encounters between the Baltimore police and African Americans in Baltimore were often fraught, as in the example of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue resident Henry Larkins, noted as a chauffeur who appears in a report published in the _Afro-American_ on February 28, 1925:

> Thirteen men were taken in a raid on a game in the rear of 2025 Madison avenue, Saturday. The game  was in progress in a garage on the second floor of which is a chauffeur's club is conducted. […] Those who were fined $1 and costs were: […] Henry Larkins, 1232 Druid Hill avenue […]

Other residents in the period included Rev. J.E. Lee, whose thoughts the _Afro-American_ reported on January 5, 1929 under the headline “Inquiring Reporter Asks Baltimore Citizens Their Main Intention For 1929,” 

> Rev. J.E. Lee, 1232 Druid Hill avenue: "To be of a greater service to my fellow man."

Around this same time, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue also served as offices for Mount Zion Cemetery, when H.E. Walden, then cemetery superintendent, advertised in the  _Afro-American_ on February 16, 1929:

> Mount Zion Cemetery Notice! All lot owner in the Mount Zion Cemetery please communicate with the office in the next thirty days.

The _Afro-American_ newspaper reported on March 8, 1930:

> Redemption of her maiden name was granted Mrs. Ida Barber, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue along with her decree of divorce from George Barber. Mrs. Barber was formerly Miss Ida King. She was married June 12, 1916, and abandoned June 4, 1920. There are no children.

The 1930 Census recorded 5 people living at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue in two apartments (presumably one of the three being vacant at the time):

- John H. Jones, Head (b. 1875, Maryland), Carpenter (Own Business)
- Minnie Jones, Wife (b. 1888, Maryland)

Separate apartment:

- Henry Wilson, Head (b. 1900, Georgia), Waiter
- Emma Wilson, Wife (b. 1900, Georgia), Maid
- Elizzie Wilson, Mother (b. 1900, Georgia), Housework

Notably, most of the homes in the row in 1930, including 1234, 1230, 1228, 1226 and 1224, are owner-occupied making 1232 Druid Hill Avenue’s continued  operation as a rental property a relative an unusual occurrence in that year.

## 1935: 1232 Druid Hill Avenue sold to John Stewart Morton

On March 7, 1935, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue is transferred to John Stewart Morton, Sr. According to the deed, a court decision on December 20, 1934 forced the sale to Morton – likely acting in his role as a member of the real estate and insurance firm formed as Samuel P. Morton & Son in 1868. By 1938, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue was a advertised for rent for $6.50 _[a week? a month? The advertisement is unclear]_. Other properties advertised in same listing included: 2437 N. Charles Street, 1417 Mt. Royal Avenue, 1127 Druid Hill Avenue, 1215 Park Avenue, 2119 St. Paul Street, 2803 Rayner.

The 1940 Census recorded 14 people living at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue in 3 apartments:

- William Thomas (b. 1855, South Carolina), Janitor
- Florence Thomas (b. 1896, Virginia), Domestic
- Hazel Curtis, Daughter (b. 1883, Virginia), Domestic
- Arthur Thomas, Son (b. 1921, Virginia), Presser

## George W. King and King Brothers

The King Brothers were book and job printers. The firm was established in 1855 by George W. King, and existed into the 1950s, run by three generations of the King family. Since 1870, the firm was regularly elected as the City Printer, printing much of the official printing for the city, and also responsible for much of the state printing as well.

In the mid-late 19th century, they were regularly elected by the City Council to serve as the City Printers (on an annual term basis). They printed all Baltimore City government documents, and were also hired to print the School Board Annual reports, as well as local, congressional, and presidential election ballots, the State of Maryland General Assembly documents for 1894 and 1896, along with much more.

His partner in the King Brothers firm was his relative (maybe son? Maybe nephew? Unclear.) Edwin W. King. His son, also named George W. King, succeeded his father in the business for the last year of his life, until the elder King's death in 1898. However, on January 4, 1899, it was announced in the _Sun_ that the firm of the King Brothers had been dissolved by the death of George W. King, but that the business would be continued under the same name by Edwin W. King. The Notice stated that Edwin W. King purchased the entire interest of the firm, and would continue it under the same name. George's son founded his own eponymously named printing company: George W. King Printing Company, which served as a competitor to the King Brothers.

He was also engaged in other business and municipal activities. In 1872, George W. King served as a Councilman for Ward 7. He also volunteered as an election judge for the 3rd, 4th and 7th precincts (according to a list appearing in the  _Baltimore Sun_ on September 19, 1889). King Brothers was one of 25 printers that organized into an Association of Employing Printers in 1877 and, a few years later, the Typographical Union. George King was also Vice-president of the Good Investment Building Association No. 3.

No other buildings associated with George King's life are extant. The buildings that house his printing business were located in downtown Baltimore, and have been lost in the Baltimore Fire, or due to redevelopment. His offices were over 10 South St. from 1858-1860, over 162 W. Baltimore St (as early as 1863 -1871), moved to 163 W. Baltimore in the early 1880s, and settled at 123 E. Baltimore Street in 1888 through 1901. In the 1920s, after George W. King's death, the offices were located at 208 N. Calvert St. All of these buildings no longer stand. The properties that served as his home over the years are also no longer extant. (37 N. Exeter from at least 1858 through the mid-1860s, 197 N. Exeter from in 1868, 378 N. Eden St. in 1872-1878.

George W. King died in November 1898, with an obituary appearing in the _Baltimore Sun_ on November 14, 1898:

> Mr. George W. King, founder of the firm of King Brothers, printers, died early Saturday morning at his home, 1232 Druid Hill avenue. Mr. King was one of the oldest active printers in the city. He was born seventy-two years ago, and at the age of seventeen years he began his apprenticeship. Upon reaching his majority he founded the firm of King Brothers. For a number of years the firm had exclusive charge of the printing for the city, and many official books came from their press.


## African Americans and Druid Hill Avenue

_Please note: This section is a working draft. We plan to update when _

The significance of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue must be understand in the context of Druid Hill Avenue’s broader history of race, segregation and Civil Rights in the late 19th and early 20th century. 

See:[1876 Map](http://collection.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/14%0A)

The geography of the neighborhood now known as Upton was shaped in the late 19th century by a series of changes to Baltimore’s Ward boundaries shaped in part by efforts to minimize the electoral power of Baltimore’s African American residents. The ward boundaries changed in 1860, 1882, and 1888 — each time keeping the area divided between the 11th, 12th, and 20th wards. Finally, in 1890, a change to the boundaries of the 11th ward allowed Harry S. Cummings won office as Baltimore’s first black City Councilman.

The wards changed again (renumbered to the 13th, 14th and 15th wards) in 1899 and, in 1901, new boundaries defined the 17th, 14th and 11th Wards. 

On Oct 21, 1899, the _Baltimore Sun_ reported on a meeting on Druid Hill Avenue, “COLORED VOTERS: A Declaration Of Independence Made At Tunstell's Hall,” writing:

> A meeting of independent colored voters of the Fourth Congressional district -was held last night at Tunstell's Hall, 435 Druid Hill avenue, to consider the position to be taken by such voters in the approaching election.

1232 Druid Hill + 17th Ward (1876) bounded by Fremont, Lafayette, Mulberry & Druid Hill Ave 

In 1906, Colonel C. Baker Clotworthy, commander of the Fifth Regiment:

> I would be deeply interested in this improvement because it means so much more than simply tearing down some houses and opening a street. Everyone in the city is familiar with the steady decrease which has taken place in the value of property in this neighborhood for the last 20 years.
> All about Richmond Market, and extending north, there are hundreds of undesirable houses and, in many cases, huts. This sore is spreading rapidly. A great many negroes, not of the best class,  gradually tenant the houses on the edge of this district and immediately the white people move from the block invaded. If this continues no one knows where it will stop.

On October 27, 1909, the _Baltimore Sun_ headlined an article on the racial transition: “NEGROES ENCROACHING / Taxpayer Tells Of Conditions In Seventeenth Ward. / FINE RESIDENCES OCCUPIED / Following Booker Washington’s Advice, They Move From Alleys To The Principal Streets.” The article quoted “a well-known taxpayer of the Seventeenth ward” who advocated in favor of the “suffrage amendment” limiting voting to white Marylanders. On the topic of housing within the Seventeenth ward, the individual is quoted:

> About six years ago the negroes had taken up entirely the residences on Biddle street, important parts of Druid Hill avenue, Division and adjacent streets.
> It was thought that they would be confined to this restricted district, but not so. About a year or so ago they began to go into the upper part of Argyle avenue, Myrtle avenue, Lanvale street and Dolphin street. […]
> St. Peter’s Protestant Episcopal Church, at Druid Hill avenue and Lanvale street, is nearly surrounded by negroes.
> The fine property of St. Mary’s Seminary, one of the oldest and best-known Catholic educational institutions in the country, is in a similar situation.
> I know that because of the negro invasion fine residence properties in this section have depreciated from 30 to 50 percent, in value, and the end is not yet.

The account claimed to observe falling prices for residential real estate, noting:

> A lady had for sale a house in the 1110 block on Argyle avenue. It was valued and offered for sale at $2,400. Before she secured a purchaser negroes moved into the house next door. She was compelled and did sell her house for $1,100. I mention this to show that the fact of negroes going into this part of the ward does depreciate property values, and consequently means a loss to the city in the way of decreased revenues from taxes. 

Educational institutions (both white and black) served as particular point of concern:

> There are four negro schools in the Seventeenth ward. The negroes of this ward do not pay enough in taxes to pay for the running of these schools. Not only do they not do this, but their very presence and intrusion into strictly white streets there cause a loss to the city in taxes.

1234 Druid Hill Avenue is the former residence of Ida Rebecca Cummings (1867-1958), an African American educator, organization leader, and clubwoman. The Encyclopedia of African-American Heritage (1997) by Susan Altman, [profiled Cummings](http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/ida-cummings-organizer-her-people) writing:

> From Baltimore, Maryland, her father was a hotel chef and catering business owner; her mother operated a boarding house at their home. Cummings was raised in an environment that stressed learning, Black unity, and community service. The family church, Metropolitan Methodist, was a station stop with Underground Railroad and offered literacy classes before the city allowed Black public schools. This atmosphere was a large part of the children’s place of academia in their early years. The Oblate Sisters of providence, an order of Black nuns, were Cummings’s first teachers.
> She later attended Hampton Institute and Morgan State College; where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1922. Cummings began teaching primary school in 1900, moving to specialized courses in her home city and Chicago. Affectionately called “Miss Ida” by her students, Cummings taught for thirty-seven years. While teaching, she participated in organizations that worked to improve housing, health care, and education for poor children. In 1904, she and other members of the Colored YMCA established the Colored Empty Stocking and Fresh Air Circle.
> They provided Christmas stockings to children who would otherwise have no gifts. The organization also aided in a healthier environment for these children by paying for boarding for them in rural homes during the summer. From 1912 to 1914, Cummings was secretary of the National Association of Colored Women and chair of the planning committee for its annual convention. She was a trustee of Bennett College, the first woman trustee of Morgan State College, and served as president of the Republican Woman’s League. Ida Cummings died in November 1958.
