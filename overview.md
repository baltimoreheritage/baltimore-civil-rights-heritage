This study covers a period of nearly 150 years years beginning in 1831 and ending in 1976. When this period began, Baltimore was the second largest city in the country and, in 1830, 28,541 free and enslaved people of color lived in Baltimore and Baltimore County. From 1831 through 1976, countless African Americans in and around Baltimore organized and advocated to protect and expand their Civil Rights under U.S. and Maryland law. In this study, we describe how buildings, parks, monuments, and neighborhoods helped to shape and structure this long Civil Rights movement and, in turn, how these places have been shaped by racism and Civil Rights activism.

## How this study is organized

The organization of this study is based significantly on the themes and periodization suggested by the National Historic Landmark (NHL) program publication _Civil Rights in America: A Framework for Identifying Significant Sites_  (2002, rev. 2009). We have adapted this framework to exclude the period of the American Revolution and the War of 1812. This change and others support our focus on the long history Civil Rights activism in Baltimore beyond the popular convention of framing Civil Rights history from 1954 to 1968. These sections are:

- 1831 – 1870
- 1870 – 1905
- 1905 – 1929
- 1929 – 1954
- 1954 – 1968
- 1968 – 1976

Each section includes a brief overview that identifies the major Civil Rights issues at the local, state and national level and describes broader changes that shaped the lives of Baltimore’s African American residents. Each section also includes a short list of featured historic places that have significant associations with Civil Rights during that period.

Following this introduction is a more detailed description of events related Civil Rights within that period organized by theme. To identify the themes, this study again followed the model of the NHL _Civil Rights Framework_ which suggested a list of key themes represented by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968:

- Equal Education
- Public Accommodation
- Voting
- Housing
- Equal Employment
- Criminal Injustice

This approach helps to connect the significance of associated historic places to the same public policies and social issues that structured the Civil Rights movement itself. In addition, this thematic structure helped the study build on the the existing scholarship on Civil Rights history in Baltimore.

 - How do these themes intersect or relate to one another? Are there themes or topics that are excluded by this study?
- How are places associated with multiple themes interpreted in this study?
- What distinguishes the study of Civil Rights heritage in Baltimore from a study of African American history?
- How does this study

_Note_: Given this project’s specific focus on the African American Civil Rights movement, this study did not include immigrant rights or American Indian rights—two topics included in the original NHL study.

Some historic places can only be interpreted by considering their significant associations with multiple themes at the same time. For example, the East-West Expressway, reflects a broader history of mid twentieth century highway planning privileging private automobiles over public transportation and urban policies that disproportionately targeted segregated black neighborhoods. The completed segment of the East-West Expressway between Martin Luther King Boulevard and Pulaski Street is therefore associated with Civil Rights issues that relate to housing, public accommodation and voting rather than a single category.

# 1831 – 1870

In 1831, Baltimore was home to over 17,888 free blacks and 10,653 enslaved African Americans. In Maryland, free black men and women could not vote and could not testify in a criminal trial. Black children could not attend Baltimore’s public schools. White employers excluded black workers from many of the opportunities created through the city’s growing industrial economy. Over the next 39 years, the lives of Baltimore’s African American residents are transformed. By 1870, 330,741 people lived in Baltimore City and County. Black men could vote and black children could attend segregated public schools. Aspiring black teachers could enroll for training at the Baltimore Normal School (established 1865) or the Centenary Biblical Institute established (established 1867), institutions continue in the present as Coppin State University and Morgan State University. This period marks the early emergence of the structures and themes that continued to drive Baltimore’s African American Civil Rights movement through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

The size of Baltimore’s free black population marked a significant change in patterns of slave-holding in Baltimore and Maryland thirty years early. Between 1800 and 1860, the proportion of Baltimore city residents who held slaves declined, the share of Baltimore’s total population held in slavery declined and the share of the black population living in freedom grew. Nearly one-third of city residents held at least one enslaved person in 1800. In 1850, slaveholders made up just over one-percent of the city’s white population. Enslaved people made up 9% of the city’s population in 1790, just under 2% in 1850, and barely 1% in 1860. A small minority of the city’s African Americans, just 20%, were free in 1790. By 1830, over 75% of the same population was free and over 90% in 1860.

This period began with [Nat Turner’s slave rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner%27s_slave_rebellion) on August 21, 1831. Although a number of prior slave revolts had taken place around the country, Nat Turner’s rebellion in Southampton, Virginia terrified many slaveholders with the prospect of similar uprisings in their own states. In Maryland, the state legislature moved in 1832 to prohibit free blacks from entering the state. The state also banned free black Marylanders from owning firearms without a certificate from county officials and outlawed the sale of alcohol, powder, and shot to blacks. Under the new policies, with the exception of Baltimore City, African Americans could longer hold religious meetings unless a white minister is present.

These restrictions made life difficult for African Americans in Baltimore and many sought their freedom by leaving Baltimore for northern states or Canada. For example, on September 3, 1838, Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery in Baltimore, traveling by train to New York City, and soon moving again to New Bedford, Massachusetts. Abolitionists and people who assisted enslaved people in escaping from bondage faced significant risks. In early 1842, [Charles Turner Torrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Turner_Torrey) organized an Underground Railroad route from Washington to Baltimore, Philadelphia and Albany. Torrey moved to Baltimore in late 1843 and, in June 1844, was arrested and confined to the Maryland Penitentiary. Torrey died in prison from tuberculosis on May 9, 1846 but the story of his life and death (published in 1847 as the [_Memoir of Rev. Charles T. Torrey who died in the penitentiary of Maryland, where he was confined for showing mercy to the poor_](https://archive.org/details/memoirofrevcharl00love2))  inspired action from abolitionists throughout the United States and Europe. The passage of the [Fugitive Slave Act of 1850](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850), pushed by Southern slaveholders to stem the flow of enslaved people moving north to freedom, led to expanded efforts by abolitionists to support the Underground Railroad and growing violence on both sides. One notable early challenge to the Fugitive Slave Act came in 1851 is the Christiana Riot (also known as the Christiana Resistance), where Baltimore-area slaveholder Edward Gorsuch and several others wounded seeking to recapture four enslaved men who had escaped to the farm of abolitionist [William Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Parker_(abolitionist)) in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

In April 1861, after months of pressure from members of the state legislature, [Governor Hicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Holliday_Hicks) convened a special session of the assembly to consider a “course of action”—but lawmakers ultimately declined to consider secession ending the discussion for good. Other proposals for Maryland to stay “neutral” in the fight went nowhere.

According to the Maryland Historical Society [Guide to Civil War Sources](https://www.mdhs.org/sites/default/files/Civil_War.pdf):

> “It is estimated that up to 60,000 Marylanders fought for the Union during the Civil War.  Maryland raised 20 infantry and four cavalry regiments for Union service, along with six artillery batteries.  There were no official Maryland troops in the Confederacy, but sympathetic Marylanders organized infantry, cavalry, and artillery units.  Others joined military outfits from other states.  As many as 25,000 Marylanders fought for the South in the war.  On the whole, those officers who fought for the Confederacy tended to represent the landed gentry of Maryland, while Union officers were more likely to be farmers or artisans.  Those Marylanders fighting for the Confederacy suffered greater combat losses than those who sided with the North.

A variety of forces began to challenge slavery early in the war. In April 1862, the emancipation of enslaved people in Washington, DC created new opportunities for enslaved blacks to escape from bondage. In 1863, the federal government began recruiting for the new U.S. Colored Troops, enlisting over 8,700 black men in six Maryland regiments.

In 1864, Maryland passed a new state constitution abolishing slavery and disenfranchised Marylanders who had left the state to fight for or live in the Confederacy and those who supported the Confederacy within the state. Under this arrangement the Maryland legislature approved the the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery throughout the nation on February 3, 1865. However, with the restoration of voting rights for many Confederate sympathizers or veterans following the end of the Civil War, the Maryland State Legislature specifically rejected the Fourteenth Amendment (guaranteeing the rights of citizens and other persons) on March 23, 1867. Three years later, the state rejected the Fifteenth Amendment on February 26, 1870. The passage of the 14th Amendment and 15th Amendment to the Constitution  passage of the 14th and 15th amendments, etc. Maryland only ratified the amendments well after they came into effect: 1959 (for the 14th) and 1973 (for the 15th).

African American churches played a major role in supporting the Underground Railroad and advocating for education and mutual support for both free and enslaved African Americans. Examples of early churches and religious organizations in this period include:

- Sharp Street Church (1787, nonextant)
- Bethel AME Church (c. 1817, nonextant)
- St. James Episcopal Church (1824, nontextant)
- Oblate Sisters of Providence (1828, nonextant)
- Orchard Street Church (1837, rebuilt 1859, 1882, extant)
- Union Baptist Church (1852, nontextant)
- Ebenezer AME Church (1865, extant)

Many of these early congregations continue to operate or have merged into other churches but few of the original buildings remain.

# 1870 – 1905

Between 1870 and 1905, African Americans in Baltimore and Maryland witnessed both new opportunities and difficult reversals in the face of growing acceptance of racist beliefs and a uncertain base of support that struggled to challenge overturn racist policies. In this period, Baltimore's black population grew quickly—from 54,000 in 1880 to 79,000 in 1900. This growth was driven largely by migration of African Americans from southern Maryland, the Eastern Shore and, by the early twentieth century, Virginia. Many of these migrants fled from the poverty and violence against African Americans, exemplified by the thirty-one lynchings that took place between 1882 and 1911.

As the city’s black population grew, it also become more concentrated and segregated from the city’s population of native-born whites and European immigrants. Even as late as 1880, the city’s black population could be found distributed evenly over three-quarters of Baltimore’s 20 wards and 8 districts. By 1890, however, African Americans began to concentrate in 11th Ward (the neighborhood of Biddle Alley) where a little over 11,000 of the 21,2699 residents were African American (making the ward 51.74% black). By 1904, the city’s Northwestern District (including the 11th Ward) held more than 40% of Baltimore’s 81,381 African Americans.[^1]

These new residents joined existing institutions like churches and fraternal organizations but also started new organizations. In February 1880, a convention of "colored delegates from each ward of the city" met at the Douglass Institute on Lexington Street to organize a new “Equal-Rights League.” The meeting heard speeches from Rev. John A. Handy, James Taylor, N.C.M. Groome, [Isaac Myers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Myers) and [Jeremiah Haralson](http://history.house.gov/People/Listing/H/HARALSON,-Jeremiah-(H000179)/). Myers observed how in Maryland:

> "Colored men cannot sit upon juries, colored children cannot be taught in the public schools by teachers of their own race, and colored people cannot get accommodations in hotels nor be admitted to practice as lawyers in State courts. By units of action the colored people will secure these rights and privileges."

Harrison, a former Congressman from Alabama who had been forced by an armed mob to flee the state in 1878, remarked that the "colored people in Maryland are free compared with their race in Alabama and the far South, where they are now fleeing from 'a second slavery that is more damnable than the first.'" The discussion continued past midnight before the meeting concluded with a resolution:

> "They set forth that neither the republican nor democratic parties in this State accord equal rights to the colored man, and the organization is promoted to secure him his rights and the respect to which he is entitled as a citizen."

This movement to independent black organizations led to changes for African Americans churches as well as political parties. In 1885, [Rev. Harvey Johnson](http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/stagser/s1259/121/6050/html/12414000.html) (1843-1923) founded the Order of Regulators, another early Civil Rights organization, which Johnson renamed the Brotherhood of Liberty in 1887. Under Rev. Johnson’s leadership, the Union Baptist Church withdrew from the 1892, the Union Baptist Church withdrew from the Maryland Baptist Union Association in response to discriminatory pay for black pastors and unequal privileges for black churches within the government of the association. In September 1897, Rev. Johnson delivered a speech in Boston, titled "A Plea For Our Work As Colored Baptists, Apart From the Whites,” that criticized white churches for their failure to support black Civil Rights efforts:

> “Why is the proposition never made to us of the necessity of co-operating in the work of abating the many forms of legal and socially oppressive laws and customs now in vogue all over the country, both North and South?”

In 1898, Rev. Johnson organized the Colored Baptist Convention of Maryland.

During the same period, between 1856 and 1900, thirty-one black newspapers were established in Baltimore. In 1892, [John H. Murphy, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Murphy,_Sr.) (1841-1922), a U.S. Colored Troop veteran, established the Afro-American newspaper by merging his own church newsletter _The Sunday School Helper_ with two other publications, _The Ledger_, established in 1882 by [Rev. George Freeman Bragg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Freeman_Bragg), rector of St. James Episcopal Church since 1891, and _The Afro-American_, published by Reverend William M. Alexander, Sharon Baptist Church.

Despite the promise represented by the Thirteenth (1865), Fourteenth (1868) and Fifteenth (1870) Amendments, elected officials at the local, state and federal consistently failed to protect the rights of black Baltimoreans. As the state remained part of the Union during the Civil War, Maryland never went through a period of Reconstruction.

The ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 added 39,000 new black voters to the total of 131,000 white voters registered in the state. Despite African American men voting in support of the Republicans, the Democratic Party candidate won the Governor’s office in every election from 1866 to 1896. Similarly, the Mayor of Baltimore remained Democratic (or a related party) from [Mayor Robert T. Banks](http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/012400/012477/html/12477bio.html) (the first elected under the new State Constitution adopted in 1867) up until the election of Alcaeus Hooper in 1895.

At the federal level, the withdrawal of Union troops from the South marked the end of Reconstruction and, as the _NHL Civil Rights Framework_ notes, “the concept of equal rights collapsed in the wake of legislative and judicial actions”, continuing:

> The Republican and Democratic parties sacrificed civil rights in exchange for white southern votes. In the _Civil Rights Cases_ of 1883, the U.S. Supreme Court found the statutory guarantee of equal enjoyment of public accommodations unconstitutional on the grounds that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment only applied to state activities and did not permit federal control of individual actions.  This decision greatly limited the rights of blacks and strengthened Jim Crow laws in the South.
 
In Maryland, as well as many other Southern states, African Americans fought to preserve their right to vote, their right to equal accommodation on public transportation, and their right to fair housing opportunities. Their efforts were met with opposition and resistance by racist white Marylanders. Between 1883 and 1905, the Maryland General Assembly passed a series of regressive measures to promote and enforce racial discrimination. These including an 1884 law banning interracial marriage (reaffirming a ban on interracial marriage from 1664), 1904 measures to require “Jim Crow” racial segregation on railroad coaches and steamboats, and a 1905 measure to disenfranchise African Americans (rejected at the polls by Maryland voters). The limited success of these efforts in Maryland in comparison to other Southern states is notable—reflecting both the size and the organization of Baltimore’s African American community.

Changes in public policy paralleled changes to the broader culture, including the growing cultural significance of the “Lost Cause”, social darwinism and scientific racism contributed to a difficult situation. This change is reflected in part through a memorial landscape in Baltimore that celebrated Confederate supporters and Confederate symbols including those built after the period of this context:

- Roger Brooke Taney Monument (1887)
- Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument (1903)
- Confederate Women’s Monument (1917)
- Lee-Jackson Monument (1948)

Additional examples can be found in the work of [William Cabell Bruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cabell_Bruce), a Baltimore lawyer who published _[The Negro Problem](https://archive.org/details/negroproblem00bruc)_ in 1891. Later examples include the 1905 novel and play [The Clansmen: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clansman:_An_Historical_Romance_of_the_Ku_Klux_Klan) (which toured in Baltimore) and, more famously, the 1915 film [The Birth of a Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_a_Nation).

Religious buildings continue to maintain their significant relationship to Civil Rights organizing and advocacy in this period. Cemeteries played a particularly important role in memorial events for black military veterans and their families following the end of the Civil War. Finally, this period includes the first examples of schools and housing built specifically for African Americans. Examples of related properties from this period include:

- Laurel Cemetery (established 1851, nonextant)

# 1905 – 1929

The period between 1905 and 1929 a continuation of the challenges of the late 19th century. However, the early 20th century also saw an expanded effort by African American activists to build national organizations and more effective coalitions with white supporters. As in other American cities, the Progressive Era (1900-1920) saw major changes to Baltimore’s urban landscape including a new park plan, a new sewer system, and a downtown transformed by the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904. Migration of African Americans from rural Maryland and Virginia continued reshaping the black neighborhoods and housing. The presentation of the Great Migration as a “crisis” for Baltimore and Maryland helped to drive campaigns in favor of segregated housing and racially disparities in policing.  

The first several decades of the 20th century saw tremendous changes at both the local and national level driven during the Progressive Era World War I (1914-1918), and the Great Depression (1929-1939). The city’s overall population grew from around 509,000 in 1900 to 859,000 in 1940. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, huge numbers of African-Americans moved to Baltimore from rural counties in Maryland and Virginia; reflecting a pattern of migration that led to dramatic growth in the black population of Washington, New York City, and Philadelphia. The city's black population grew from 79,000 in 1900 to 84,000 in 1910.

**Note**: What are the labor and housing issues related to race and Civil Rights during World War I?

This period saw a major growth in national Civil Rights organizing efforts, beginning with the Niagara Movement in 1905. In 1905, Rev. Harvey Johnson and four other members of the Brotherhood of Liberty were among the twenty-nine people from fourteen states who met near Buffalo, New York to form the organization. Historian Bettye Collier-Thomas noted that W.E.B. DuBois was in “close contact with members of the Brotherhood... as he frequently traveled there to deliver speeches” between 1895 and 1910. Collier-Thomas notes, that the Brotherhood “willingly shared twenty years of experience, strategy development and know-how with the founders at Niagara.” The Niagara Movement ended after just a few years but led to the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. The National Urban League, organized with a clear focus on the needs of black migrants to northern and border state cities was established just a year later in 1910.

Local connections to national organizations are also visible in the example of the Negro Business League holding their Ninth Annual Convention in Baltimore in 1908. The local chapter of the NAACP was established in Baltimore on April 4, 1912.

Decades of organizing and advocacy yielded some progress. For example, in 1920, the Baltimore YWCA and Colored Women's YWCA merged—reflecting a growing commitment by white liberals to form and support interracial organizations. Similarly, in 1927, the Maryland state legislature established the “Interracial Commission” (Chapter 559, Acts of 1927) to create a framework for discussing Civil Rights policy issues. Unfortunately, the immediate impact of such modest and incremental changes to improve the lives of black people in Baltimore was limited.
