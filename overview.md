This study covers a period of nearly 150 years beginning in 1831 and ending in 1976. When this period began, Baltimore was the second largest city in the country and, in 1830, 28,541 free and enslaved people of color lived in Baltimore and Baltimore County. From 1831 through 1976, countless African Americans in and around Baltimore organized and advocated to protect and expand their Civil Rights under U.S. and Maryland law. Individuals and organizations participated and drew support from citywide, statewide and national organizations—often working to build interracial and interreligious coalitions. In this study, we describe how buildings, parks, monuments, and neighborhoods helped to shape and structure this long Civil Rights movement and, in turn, how racism and Civil Rights activism shaped these places.

## How is this study organized?

This study is organized around the themes and periodization suggested by _Civil Rights in America: A Framework for Identifying Significant Sites_  (2002, rev. 2009) published by the  the National Historic Landmark (NHL) program.^[Given this project’s specific focus on the African American Civil Rights movement, this study did not include immigrant rights or American Indian rights—two topics included in the original NHL study.] We modified the periodization to exclude the period of the American Revolution and the War of 1812—beginning instead with Nat Turner's Rebellion in Virginia. We also made changes to the periodization in the 20th century to support a closer look at black resistance to segregation and discrimination before World War II. This created six sections that each begin with major events that shaped the local and national context for African American Civil Rights.

Following approach suggested by the 2009 white paper _The Components of a Historic Contest_ by Barbara Wyatt, each section (or context) addresses:

- how the Civil Rights movement developed and changed;
- why those changes took place;
- what contributions individuals and groups made to those changes;
- and what factors outside of Baltimore contributed to those changes.

A series of thematic studies supplement these chronologically organized sections with detailed descriptions of key events and patterns. To identify the themes, this study again followed the model of the NHL _Civil Rights Framework_ which suggested a list of key themes represented by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968:

- Equal Education
- Public Accommodation
- Voting
- Housing
- Equal Employment
- Criminal Injustice

Our goal with this approach is to connect the significance of associated historic places to the same public policies and social issues that structured the Civil Rights movement itself. This structure also helped us to build on the existing scholarship on Civil Rights history in Baltimore.

A few important questions remain open for discussion:

- What distinguishes the study of Civil Rights heritage in Baltimore from a study of African American history?
 - How do these themes intersect or relate to one another? Are there themes or topics that are excluded by this study? How are places associated with multiple themes interpreted in this study?
- How does race intersect with gender, disability, or identification as a sexual minority?

## What sources did we use for this study?

Since we used  _Civil Rights in America: A Framework for Identifying Significant Sites_  (2002, rev. 2009), to establish the framework for this study, it made sense to use the related studies from the series as key sources:

- Civil Rights in America: Racial Desegregation of Public Accommodations (2004, rev. 2009)
- Civil Rights in America: Racial Desegregation in Public Education in the United States (2000) and supplement (2004)
- Civil Rights in America: Racial Voting Rights (2007, rev. 2009)

Key secondary sources are listed in a separate bibliography.

Key primary sources included:

- The Baltimore Sun (ProQuest Historical Newspaper Database)
- The Afro-American Newspaper (ProQuest Historical Newspaper Database)
- Coleman Directories (Maryland State Archives)
