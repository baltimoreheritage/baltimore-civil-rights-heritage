This study covers a period of nearly 150 years beginning in 1831 and ending in 1976. When this period began, Baltimore was the second largest city in the country and, in 1830, 28,541 free and enslaved people of color lived in Baltimore and Baltimore County. From 1831 through 1976, countless African Americans in and around Baltimore organized and advocated to protect and expand their Civil Rights under U.S. and Maryland law. Individuals and organizations participated and drew support from citywide, statewide and national organizations—often working to build interracial and interreligious coalitions.

In this study, we describe how buildings, parks, monuments, and neighborhoods helped to shape and structure this long Civil Rights movement and, in turn, how these places have been shaped by racism and Civil Rights activism.

## How this study is organized

We based the organization of this study on the themes and periodization suggested by the National Historic Landmark (NHL) program publication _Civil Rights in America: A Framework for Identifying Significant Sites_  (2002, rev. 2009). We have modified the periodization to exclude the period of the American Revolution and the War of 1812—beginning instead with Nat Turner's Rebellion in Virginia. Given this project’s specific focus on the African American Civil Rights movement, this study did not include immigrant rights or American Indian rights—two topics included in the original NHL study. The chronological periods for each section are:

- [1831 – 1870](/overview/1831-1870)
- [1870 – 1905](/overview/1870-1905)
- 1905 – 1929
- 1929 – 1954
- 1954 – 1968
- 1968 – 1976

Each section includes a brief overview that describes:

- how Civil Rights issues developed and changed at a local, state and national level;
- why those changes took place;
- what contributions individuals and groups made to that process;
- and what factors outside of Baltimore (state, national, and international events) contributed to those changes.

Following this introduction is a more detailed description of events related Civil Rights within that period organized by theme. To identify the themes, this study again followed the model of the NHL _Civil Rights Framework_ which suggested a list of key themes represented by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968:

- Equal Education
- Public Accommodation
- Voting
- Housing
- Equal Employment
- Criminal Injustice

Our goal with this approach is to connect the significance of associated historic places to the same public policies and social issues that structured the Civil Rights movement itself. This structure also helped us to build on the existing scholarship on Civil Rights history in Baltimore.

A few important questions remain open for discussion:

- What distinguishes the study of Civil Rights heritage in Baltimore from a study of African American history?
 - How do these themes intersect or relate to one another? Are there themes or topics that are excluded by this study? How are places associated with multiple themes interpreted in this study?
- How does race intersect with gender, disability, or identification as a sexual minority?

Since we used  _Civil Rights in America: A Framework for Identifying Significant Sites_  (2002, rev. 2009), to establish the framework for this study, it made sense to use the related studies from the series as key sources:

- Civil Rights in America: Racial Desegregation in Public Education in the United States (2000) and supplement (2004)

# 1905 – 1929

The period between 1905 and 1929 a continuation of the challenges of the late 19th century. However, the early 20th century also saw an expanded effort by African American activists to build national organizations and more effective coalitions with white supporters. As in other American cities, the Progressive Era (1900-1920) saw major changes to Baltimore’s urban landscape including a new park plan, a new sewer system, and a downtown transformed by the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904. Migration of African Americans from rural Maryland and Virginia continued reshaping the black neighborhoods and housing. The presentation of the Great Migration as a “crisis” for Baltimore and Maryland helped to drive campaigns in favor of segregated housing and racially disparities in policing.  

The first several decades of the 20th century saw tremendous changes at both the local and national level driven during the Progressive Era World War I (1914-1918), and the Great Depression (1929-1939). The city’s overall population grew from around 509,000 in 1900 to 859,000 in 1940. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, huge numbers of African-Americans moved to Baltimore from rural counties in Maryland and Virginia; reflecting a pattern of migration that led to dramatic growth in the black population of Washington, New York City, and Philadelphia. The city's black population grew from 79,000 in 1900 to 84,000 in 1910.

**Note**: What are the labor and housing issues related to race and Civil Rights during World War I?

This period saw a major growth in national Civil Rights organizing efforts, beginning with the Niagara Movement in 1905. In 1905, Rev. Harvey Johnson and four other members of the Brotherhood of Liberty were among the twenty-nine people from fourteen states who met near Buffalo, New York to form the organization. Historian Bettye Collier-Thomas noted that W.E.B. DuBois was in “close contact with members of the Brotherhood... as he frequently traveled there to deliver speeches” between 1895 and 1910. Collier-Thomas notes, that the Brotherhood “willingly shared twenty years of experience, strategy development and know-how with the founders at Niagara.” The Niagara Movement ended after just a few years but led to the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. The National Urban League, organized with a clear focus on the needs of black migrants to northern and border state cities was established just a year later in 1910.

Local connections to national organizations are also visible in the example of the Negro Business League holding their Ninth Annual Convention in Baltimore in 1908. The local chapter of the NAACP was established in Baltimore on April 4, 1912.

Decades of organizing and advocacy yielded some progress. For example, in 1920, the Baltimore YWCA and Colored Women's YWCA merged—reflecting a growing commitment by white liberals to form and support interracial organizations. Similarly, in 1927, the Maryland state legislature established the “Interracial Commission” (Chapter 559, Acts of 1927) to create a framework for discussing Civil Rights policy issues. Unfortunately, the immediate impact of such modest and incremental changes to improve the lives of black people in Baltimore was limited.
