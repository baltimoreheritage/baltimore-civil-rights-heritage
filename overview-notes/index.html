<p>…</p>
<h2 id="how-is-this-study-organized">How is this study organized?</h2>
<p>This overview is organized chronologically into seven periods, largely matching the organization of the National Historic Landmarks Program Civil Rights in America Framework (2002, revised 2008). Within each period is a summary context on the history of Civil Rights for African Americans in Baltimore with additional context on Maryland and the nation during the same period. At the conclusion of each section is a list of related sites – briefly described – that closely relate to the history and significant themes of that period.</p>
<p>The period of study begins in 1776, when the Declaration of Independence called for a new republic where “all men are created equal” and ends in 1976—12 years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A final section brings the story up through the present and includes a brief historiography of how African American Civil Rights heritage has been addressed and memorialized.</p>

<h2 id="thematic-framework">Thematic Framework</h2>
<p>This overview is accompanied by a series of thematic studies that look at Civil Rights for African Americans in Baltimore in the areas of housing, voting, equitable education, equitable employment, public accommodation, and criminal injustice. These thematic studies are organized along similar lines as this overview to aid in comparison. As the overall project is designed to focus primarily on the movement to secure Civil Rights for African Americans, the aspects of the local, state and national context that affect women, Native Americans, Latino and Hispanic people, and LGBTQ populations may not receive the same level of close consideration. However, this study recognizes the importance of intersectionality in shaping the experiences of individuals within society and attempts to draw out relevant connections between women’s suffrage, feminism, and the movement for LGBTQ rights in Baltimore as they affect African American individuals and communities.</p>
<h1 id="section">1831 – 1870</h1>
<p>  Founded over a century before the U.S. Civil War, Baltimore has a long history of black resistance to inequality and interracial efforts to win freedom for enslaved African-Americans and justice for free blacks. Churches established by black Baltimoreans before the Civil War later played a critical role in supporting the Civil Rights movement.   ## Baltimore Between 1800 and 1860, the circumstances for African Americans living in Baltimore changed dramatically. The proportion of Baltimore city residents who held slaves declined, the share of Baltimore’s total population held in slavery declined and the share of the black population living in freedom grew. Nearly one-third of city residents held at least one enslaved person in 1800. In 1850, slaveholders made up just over one-percent of the city’s white population. Enslaved people made up 9% of the city’s population in 1790, just under 2% in 1850, and barely 1% in 1860. A small minority of the city’s African Americans, just 20%, were free in 1790. By 1830, over 75% of the same population was free and over 90% in 1860.</p>
<p>The city’s total population grew from 13,503 in 1790 to 46,555 in 1810 and 62,738 in 1820.   In the 19th century, Baltimore’s African Americans secured more equitable conditions in part through the growth of independent churches, social organization and schools where black people could exercise greater independence and avoid some of the direct discrimination that they often faced from white-controlled churches or other institutions.   For example, in 1787 a group of free blacks withdrew from Lovely Lane Methodist Church to form an independent prayer meeting. The group gathered at Caleb Hyland’s boot black cellar likely left in protest over the congregation’s continued tolerance of slave-holding by church members and segregated worship services.   <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~jweisenf/northstar/volume8/melton.html" class="uri">https://www.princeton.edu/~jweisenf/northstar/volume8/melton.html</a>   The city’s first separate school for African Americans began in 1797 when the Maryland Society for the Abolition of Slavery opened the Baltimore African Academy. One of the school’s early teachers, Daniel Coker, began preaching to members of the Colored Methodist Society around 1808 and led the formation of the Bethel Church in 1815.   &gt; “In 1828, Haitian women refugees founded the Oblate Sisters of Providence, a Catholic religious institute for African-American women. The Oblate Sisters were the first all-Black order of Roman Catholic nuns.<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=tzlYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Dr.%20J.%20Marcus%20Cargill&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q=Dr.%20J.%20Marcus%20Cargill&amp;f=false">2</a>”   African American Baptists followed a similar path in 1852 when John Carey organized the city’s first black Baptist church with 57 members meeting at a small building on Lewis Street near Mullikin.  </p>
<h2 id="maryland">Maryland</h2>
<p>  Churches and religious leadership played a critical role in early efforts to preserve Civil Rights.   ●      Colonization Society and resistance ●      Dred Scott Decision, Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad ●      Recruiting black troops and Union Troops in Maryland ●       New state constitution ends slavery in Maryland, 1864 - Republicans and black voters   ## National The beginning of this period shows the ideals of personal freedom expressed in the founding documents of the United States. In 1776, the Declaration of Independence declared that “all men are created equal” and, in 1788, the U.S. Constitution purported to “secure the blessings of liberty” to the American people. These rights and liberties, however, were meant only for white men of property. The Naturalization Act of 1790, excluded</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nonwhite men who were of other than African descent were also excluded, as Congress had stipulated in that only “free white persons” could become citizens. Ironically, the majority of white males who became naturalized citizens between 1830 and 1860 enjoyed manhood suffrage and other rights denied to native-born nonwhites.   Crusaders against slavery and racism advanced the concept of equality before the law, regardless of race, and often quoted the Declaration of Independence to condemn the institution of slavery that evolved after the first Africans landed involuntarily at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619.  Many abolitionists searched for color-blind citizenship, while slavery proponents viewed nonwhites as inferior races unworthy of Constitutional rights.     # 1870 – 1905   In this period, the city’s overall population grew from around 267,000 to 509,000. TK: What did black population do in this period?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the U.S. Census, Baltimore’s total population grew from 212,418 in 1860 to 332,313 in 1880 and 434,439 in 1890.</p>
<h2 id="baltimore">Baltimore</h2>
<p>  The end of the U.S. Civil War created tremendous opportunities for African Americans in Baltimore — both for those who lived in the city before the war and the thousands of formerly enslaved people who moved to the city after their emancipation under Maryland’s 1864 constitution. The city saw the continued growth of independent black institutions that took a significant role in sustaining the city’s black residents and advocating for political and social equality. Despite the</p>
<p>Particular challenges for African Americans in this period included police violence and criminal injustice, illustrated in the example of the “Cake-Walk Homicide” where Daniel Brown was killed by Baltimore police officer Patrick McDonald.</p>
<p>This period saw the growth of new local institutions such as the Centenary Biblical Institute established in 1867 at Sharp Street Church. In 1882, Baltimore established a two-year Colored High School. In 1885, Reverend Harvey Johnson founded the Order of Regulators — a civil rights advocacy organization that later changed names to the Brotherhood of Liberty in 1887. In 1892, the Union Baptist Church withdrew from the Maryland Baptist Union Association. That same year, John Murphy, Sr., established the Afro (TK: What was it called the year it was established?)</p>
<p>Securing opportunities for black teachers in black schools had been an issue for African-Americans advocates since at least 1880 and, in 1896, Dr. J. Marcus Cargill (TK?-1915) proposed a bill to the City Council to gradually employ African American teachers in Baltimore City schools for African American children (was this bill originally proposed by Harvey Johnson - <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=tzlYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Dr.%20J.%20Marcus%20Cargill&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q=Dr.%20J.%20Marcus%20Cargill&amp;f=false">see here</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to the success of the African-Americans at building separate institutions, individuals also pushed back against segregation in law, politics and education. In 1885, Everett J. Waring became the first African-American admitted to practice law in Baltimore. In 1891, Harry T. Pratt enrolled at the Maryland Institute College of Art.</p>
<p>In politics, Civil Rights was closely linked to the local Republican party. For example, on May 19, 1870 the Fifteenth Amendment Parade and Celebration functioned as both a celebration of black freedom and a rally for Republican support. In 1890, Harry Smythe Cummings became the first African-American elected to the Baltimore City Council representing the 11th Ward. He was followed in 1895 by Dr. J. Marcus Cargill. Cargill, together with physicians William T. Carr and William H. Thompson, established Provident Hospital in 1894. A group of African-American educators established the Maryland Progressive State Colored Teachers Association in 1886 - an organization that helped to push to open new black schools. In 1890, only 35 of 210 teachers employed at African-American schools were African-American.</p>
<p>Barbara Bair writing in <em>To Make Our World Anew</em>, “the 1890s produced so many extraordinary African-American women leaders and organizations that it became known as the “Woman’s Era.”</p>
<p>Barbara Bair writing in <em>To Make Our World Anew</em> observe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The independence of black churches within mixed-race small towns and cities, and the willingness of their members to contribute money and volunteer work to their churches, made the church the strongest single single institution of African-American self-help in the 1880s and 1890s. (p.42)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>September 18, 1895 - Book T. Washington speech at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia, Barbara Bair writing in <em>To Make Our World Anew</em> remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Washington’s speech symbolizes a time when new black leaders appeared in many fields of political and cultural achievement, and when themes of compromise or accommodation, self-assertion and protest, were found simultaneously in the public life and leadership of black people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”In exchange for greater future material prosperity and the promise of more evenhanded administration of the law, African Americans, Washington implied, would not make immediate or forceful claims for equal rights or opportunities. Nor would they attempt to share in the social privileges enjoyed by whites in public and private settings.” (p.45)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barbara Bair writing in <em>To Make Our World Anew</em> remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of the erosion of civil rights in the late nineteenth century, black leadership had also declined in party politics and government. Although twenty-two African Americans were elected to the U.S. Congress between 1870 and the turn of the century, the post-Civil War white backlash against an integrated Republican party in the South effectively ended Republican power and Reconstruction reforms by 1877.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barbara Bair writing in <em>To Make Our World Anew</em> remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning with Mississippi in 1890, South Carolina in 1895, Louisiana in 1898, and North Carolina in 1900, and Alabama and Virginia shortly after the turn of the century, several states amended their constitutions with the intention of denying blacks the right to vote. (p.26)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barbara Bair writing in <em>To Make Our World Anew</em> noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Between 1882 and 1901 more than one hundred people were lynched each year, the great majority of them blacks living in Southern states. Almost two thousand lynching of African Americans were officially reported in those two decades. Additional murders by lynching occurred, but they went unreported as such in local records and overall statistics.” (p. 28)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James R. Grossman in <em>To Make Our World Anew</em> writing about Southern migration to northern cities (1900-1929):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”Black Southerners arriving in cities encountered an array of agencies committed to helping them find places in the city. The most systematically active and professionalized of these were the local branches of the National Urban League. Founded in 1911, the Urban League added dozens of branches during the decade after 1916, in a wide variety of cities across the country.” (p.116)</p>

<p>  Despite these challenges, many African Americans found opportunities to build better lives and used their hard-won resources to organize and advocate for more equal treatment for themselves and their communities.</p>
<p>At the state level, the Democrats retained first control  </p>
<p>  ## National   From Theme Study:   &gt; In 1865, following the Civil War, southern state legislatures began enacting Black Codes to restrict freedmen’s rights and maintain the plantation system. The Republican-controlled Congress responded to these measures between 1866 and 1870 by passing the three great postwar constitutional amendments (Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth) that abolished slavery, guaranteed the newly freed blacks equal protection of the laws, and gave all male American citizens the right to vote regardless of their “race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” Congress also passed the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1875 to protect the rights of all Americans (excluding Indians) regardless of race.  Henceforth, all persons born in the U.S. were national citizens with rights to “the full and equal enjoyment” of public places, among other rights.  Freedmen and other persons of color looked forward to asserting their political rights and receiving equal treatment before the law, but they were soon disappointed.   &gt; As Reconstruction came to an end in 1877, the concept of equal rights collapsed in the wake of legislative and judicial actions. The Republican and Democratic parties sacrificed civil rights in exchange for white southern votes. In the _Civil Rights Cases _of 1883, the U.S. Supreme Court found the statutory guarantee of equal enjoyment of public accommodations unconstitutional on the grounds that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment only applied to state activities and did not permit federal control of individual actions.  This decision greatly limited the rights of blacks and strengthened Jim Crow laws in the South.   &gt; The passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments was partly responsible for the singular focus of women’s rights activists on the right to vote. The enfranchisement of African American men, which many women supported, in effect embedded into the Constitution a gender-based definition of citizenship and divided the women’s rights activists in the northern and midwestern states who had been part of the abolition movement. For some, guaranteeing only black men the right to vote was a necessary compromise at the end of a long and incredibly bloody war.  For others, it constituted a betrayal of the equal rights concept.  For all the women who demanded civic equality, women’s suffrage soon became the principal objective. It was also the most controversial goal because it constituted a direct claim to participation in public life.   In the 1890s, Congress and the Supreme Court began redefining which minorities were entitled to citizenship.   Despite these partial successes, in 1896 the final devastating blow to the civil rights gains made during Reconstruction came in the form of judicially sanctioned segregation.  In <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the concept of separate but equal public facilities, thus ensuring racial segregation and discrimination, especially in education. Whites would use this concept to keep African Americans, as well as other minorities, in separate and unequal facilities.    Migration between 1880 and 1900, Baltimore’s black population grew from 54,000 to 79,000 (47%).</p>
<p>Between 1856 and 1900, 31 black newspapers were established in Baltimore reflecting the low rate of illiteracy among African-Americans in Baltimore - less than 17% of black people in Baltimore in 1904 could neither read nor write (compared to a rate of 47.1% in the South Atlantic region).</p>
<p>The ratification of the FIfteenth Ammendment in 1870 added 39,000 new black voters to the total of 131,000 white voters registered in the state.   # 1905 – 1929</p>
<p>The first several decades of the 20th century saw tremendous changes at both the local and national level driven during the Progressive Era (1900-1920), World War I (1914-1918), and the Great Depression (1929-1939). The city’s overall population grew from around 509,000 in 1900 to 859,000 in 1940. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, huge numbers of African-Americans moved to Baltimore from rural counties in Maryland and Virginia; reflecting a pattern of migration that led to dramatic growth in the black population of Washington, New York City, and Philadelphia. The city’s black population grew from 79,000 in 1900 to 84,000 in 1910.</p>
<p>The Niagara Movement was organized in 1905 leading to the establishment of the NAACP in 1909. The National Urban League  followed just a year later in 1910.</p>
<p>Military service during WWI gave many African-Americans renewed aspirations for equality and opportunity following their service in Europe. W.E.B. DuBois channeled the views of many black soldiers returning from the war, when he wrote for <em>The Crisis</em> in May 1919:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We <em>return</em> We_return from fighting._ We_return fighting._ Make way for Democracy! We saved it in France, and by the Great Jehovah, we will save it in the United States of America or know the reasons why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, many veterans returned to Baltimore (and other cities) to face the same discrimination they encountered before the war</p>
<p>African-Americans in Baltimore and their allies fought against the rise of “Jim Crow” in Maryland during the early 1900s with success in some areas (the preservation of voting rights) and failure in others (widespread discrimination in employment and housing). The period was also shaped by the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920 granting voting rights to women, white and black, for the first time in Maryland’s history.    In Baltimore, the early 1900s saw the rise of efforts to enforce racial segregation exemplified by the increasing popularity of deed restrictions, racial covenants and public legal measures notably the West Segregation Ordinance passed in 1910.   TK: Voting rights issues - preserved in Baltimore City but what about other jurisdictions</p>
<p>At the same time, a new generation of leadership in churches, schools and African American businesses began to shape a new direction for civil rights in Baltimore. Young Colored Men’s Reading Club opened a library in 1916. Carl Murphy succeeds his father as editor and publisher at the Afro in 1922. Douglass Memorial Church split from from Bethel AME Church in 1925 [over what issue? Is this relevant?]. In 1925, Francis M. Woods becomes supervisor and later director of the Baltimore Colored Schools. When start of the Great Depression in 1929 created new challenges around widespread unemployment, the City-Wide Young Peoples Forum organized to address this issue. The Forum organized the “Buy Where You Can Work” campaign in 1931. Thurgood Marshall began work for Baltimore NAACP in 1934 and Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson took office as the president of the Baltimore NAACP in 1935.   Success from renewed advocacy was significant but rarely total. In 1926, the defense league won salary equality for black teachers. </p>
<p>The stock market crash in 1929 that marked the beginning of the Great Depression created new challenges for African-Americans around the nation who continued to be excluded from local unions and were subject to the policy of “last hired and first fired.” While the federal government’s New Deal programs brought some relief, discrimination persisted in the administration of these programs. In addition, funding for the Public Works Administration supported local “slum-clearance” efforts that disproportionately impacted African-Americans in the example of the extension of Howard Street and the construction of the Howard Street bridge which displaced hundreds of African-American households.</p>
<p>Despite this failure at the local level, in Baltimore (as in other communities) African-Americans began to switch their affiliation from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party. The switch came in part from leadership at the national level, such as in 1939 when Roosevelt established the Civil Rights Section of the Justice Department to combat lynching (although the section failed to secure any convictions until 1946).</p>
<p>Public accommodation?</p>
<p>In the summer of 1929, the <em>Afro</em> undertook a campaign to “place responsibility for jim-crow buses operated by the Baltimore United Street Railway company” attacking the company policy of instructing bus drivers to “tell Negroes they can’t ride, but don’t put them off.”</p>

<p>On December 4, 1931, an African-American man named Matthew Williams was lynched on the Eastern Shore. On October 18, 1933, George Armwood Lynched in Princess Anne County.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was for the purpose of considering matters concerning the “welfare of colored people residing in the State…, recommend legislation and sponsor movements looking to the welfare of said people, and to the improvement of interracial relations, and to cooperate with other State agencies to these ends” that the General Assembly created the Interracial Commission of Maryland in 1927 (Chapter 559 of 1927).  The Commission was originally comprised of eighteen (18) members, nine (9) of which were Black and nine (9) were white.  The Commission had no investigative or enforcement powers.  However, in the realm of public service, the Commission came out against the Act of 1904.  More commonly known as the Kerbin “Jim Crow” Law after its sponsor, Delegate William G. Kerbin of Worcester County, this required separate seating, dining, and sleeping arrangements for Blacks and Whites on railroads and steamship lines operating strictly within the State’s borders. In the arena of education, the Interracial Commission brought to light the vast disparities in education between the white and black communities.  Specifically, the Commission found that: 1. Black teachers received a salary of $640 per year, while white teachers received $1150. 2. Per pupil spending was $95 per year per white student, while only $45 per year per black students. 3. White schools were open 187 days per year, while black schools were open 168 days per year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1934, the “barring of colored passengers from busses in the city” was officially ended after an order issued to all drivers by W. E. Martin, superintendent of busses of the United Street Railway Company.</p>
<p>In 1934, Carroll Park opened to black golfers but only on a staggered basis to avoid white and black players from mixing on the course. In 1938, this partial policy was attacked in a lawsuit by African American golfers Dallas Nicholas and William I. Gosnell.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>The 1935 decision in Murray v. Maryland won the admission  </p>
<p>National efforts paralleled the changes in Baltimore during this period. Local efforts to fight employment discrimination were inspired by national efforts to promote “Don’t Buy Where You Can’t Work” Campaigns in the 1930s. Similarly campaigns against Eastern Shore lynchings in 1931 and 1933 related closely to the national campaign against lynching.   From THE NAACP CAMPAIGN FOR TEACHERS’ SALARY EQUALIZATION: AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN EDUCATORS AND THE EARLY CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning with the Pittsburgh Courier, African American newspaper publishers launched a “Double V” campaign?vic tory against fascism and racism at home and abroad?and NAACP membership and branches grew rapidly during the war years. Historian Risa L. Goluboff reported that“between 1940 and 1946, theNAACP grew from355 branches and a membership of 50,556 to 1,073 branches and membership of about 450,000.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Equalization strategy in education:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Houston’s equalization strategy was conceived with two main strands of attack in mind. The first was gaining admission forAfrican Americans into all white graduate and professional schools. Houston won an early case inMurray v. Maryland (1935), which did in fact lead to desegregation when theMaryland Court ofAppeals ordered theUniversity ofMaryland Law School to admit African American applicant Donald Gaines Murray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teacher salary equalization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The salary equalization campaign yielded quicker results and proved more effective in generating enthusiasm and action than the higher education cases. Houston described the campaign as “indissolubly linked with all other major activities of the association,” and Kenneth Janken, biographer of NAACP executive secretary Walter White, found that the campaign was “wildly popular.”8</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Between 1939 and 1947, the NAACP won twenty-seven of the thirty-one teachers’ salary equalization cases it fought in the South. African American teachers’ salaries steadily rose from 50 percent of white teachers’ salaries in 1930, to 65 percent in 1945, to 85 percent in 1950. In 1950 the dele gates to theNAACP annual convention voted to abandon its demands for equal facilities and to demand total desegregation instead. The teachers’ salary equalization campaign was therefore an important testing-ground and learning experience for the NAACP’s legal teamforthefuturebattlesthatlayahead</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In his home state ofMaryland, Marshall won the first out-of-court settlement to equalize African American teachers’ salaries in the case ofMontgomery County teacherWilliam Gibbs in 1937. The first successful court ruling in favor of equalization came in the case ofAnne Arundel County teacherWalter Mills in 1939.</p>

<h2 id="baltimore-maryland">Baltimore &amp; Maryland</h2>
<p>  The 1940s and 1950s, during and after World War II, saw a quickening pace of change and more aggressive campaign of protest and media against racism and discrimination. Under the continued editorial direction of Carl Murphy, <em>The Afro</em> both documented local Civil Rights efforts and advocated for change through their own reporting. The March on Annapolis held on April 23, 1942 to protest police violence led to the creation of the Commission to Study the Problems Affecting the Colored Population later that year. In 1943, the Baltimore chapter of the NAACP organized a prominent Register-and-Vote campaign and, in 1946, Victorine Adams organized the Colored Democratic Women – initially a group to encourage black women to vote and later a critical force in encouraging black women to seek elected office.   Public accommodation emerged as one of the prominent issues in this period. In 1942, the Afro published a series entitled the “Nazi of the Week,” equating discrimination and racism in Baltimore and the U.S. to support of Hitler’s fascism. During the winter of 1945, the Afro highlighted discrimination at downtown department stores around Lexington Market through their campaign labelling downtown stores as “Orchids” or “Onions” to highlight discrimination against African-American shoppers.</p>
<p>In December 1947, the impromptu organization of an integrated youth basketball game at Garrison Junior High prompted protests and counter-protests. In 1948, an interracial group of young people played on a segregated tennis in Druid Hill Park to protest the segregation of recreational facilities in the park. In 1949, in Boyer v. Garrett, a group filed suit “against the Director, Superintendent, and members of the Board of Recreation and Parks, municipal police of Baltimore, the Mayor, and the City Council alleged violation of constitutional rights in the segregation policy for athletic facilities.” In February 1948, two Morgan State College students were arrested while picketing the Ford Theater in downtown Baltimore. After four more years of regular protests, Ford’s Theatre integrated in 1952. In 1951, the Maryland legislature ended segregation on trains and boats and Governor McKeldin replaced the 1942 Commission with the new Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations. In 1953, the Lyric Theatre booked African American singer Marian Anderson. In 1953, Governor McKeldin opened all state parks to African Americans visitors.</p>
<h2 id="national">National</h2>
<p>At the national level, this period saw a new urgency emerge of the new Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) founded in 1942.  Black migration Baltimore from the South and rural Maryland brought new voters to the city and state whose support proved critical in changing</p>
<p>Around the country, the combination of new opportunities for work in wartime industry, service in the military, and a national discussion that contrasted American ideals of democracy with European fascism led to a new civil rights agenda. A proposal by A. Philip Randolph in January 1941 to organize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_Movement">a march on Washington, DC</a> protesting discrimination against African-Americans. The movement to organize a march and protest persistent discrimination forced President President Franklin D. Roosevelt to issue Executive Order 8802, establishing the first Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC).</p>
<p>Population publications and federal   &gt; Social pressure to end segregation also increased during and after the war. In 1944, the publication of Gunnar Myrdal’s classic study of race relations, _An American Dilemma, _“offered an uncompromising account of the long history of racial injustice and a candid analysis of the economics of inequality.”4   President Harry S Truman continued President Roosevelt’s use of executive powers outside of Congress to advance black civil rights. In 1946, Truman commissioned a study of racial inequities that called for an end to segregation in America.</p>
<p>Completed in 1947, _To Secure These Rights _as well as legal victories in Supreme Court cases paved the way for the Second Reconstruction. In 1948, Truman issued Executive Order 9981, mandating “equality of treatment and opportunity for all those who serve in our country’s defense . . . without regard to race, color, religion or national origin.”   ## 1951: CORE’s Baltimore chapter founded</p>

<p>In 1954, Baltimore public housing first allowed integration.</p>
<p>Education also In August of that same year, Baltimore’s Polytechnic High School opened to black children on a limited basis.</p>
<p>In 1954, Baltimore politician Harry Coles was elected to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>In the mid 1950s and early 1960s, the conversation around Civil Rights was increasingly part of the mainstream in Baltimore and support for desegregation continued to grow. The decision in Brown v. Board of Education and a fast-paced racial transition in many Baltimore neighborhoods forced the issue. In 1955, the Baltimore Sun published a series, and  “The City We Live In,” highlighting issues around race and civil rights. That same year, the Baltimore City Council published “A City in Transition,” addressing the same issues. In 1956, the Council passed the Baltimore City Equal Employment Ordinance.   1955 also saw continued victories against segregation in public accommodations. In January, Read’s Drug Store desegregated after protests by Morgan State students and CORE. Later that year, a federal court ordered Baltimore to desegregate public swimming pools in Dawson v. Baltimore City, 220 F.2d 386 (4th Cir. Md. 1955) – a decision affirmed by the Supreme Court in Baltimore City v. Dawson, 350 U.S. 877(1955). [Desegregation of public pools, Sandy Point Park, and Fort Smallwood Municipal Beaches]</p>
<p>Protests continued, however, with student sit-ins at the Northwood Shopping Center and Hooper’s Restaurant in 1960 and at the Gwynn Oak Amusement Park in Baltimore County in 1963. At the state level, the legislature approved an Open Accommodations law covering twelve Maryland counties in 1963 and extended that to the whole state in 1964. The decision in Griffin v.

<p>In 1954, the Supreme Court decision in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a> made the segregation of Maryland’s schools illegal—overturning the decision in Plessy v. Ferguson from 58 years earlier. African-Americans in Maryland and around the nation struggled to see change in the face of both visible “Massive Resistance,” and more subtle or invisible forms of resistance. In response to the efforts of direct action protests around the country and intense lobbying by Civil Rights advocates in Washington, D.C., the consequential decision was followed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957">Civil Rights Act of 1957</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1960">Civil Rights Act of 1960</a>.</p>
<p>The 1957 legislation signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction, created the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The Commission—though limited to fact-finding—played a key role in documenting injustice, leading to expanded authority under the 1964 Civil Rights legislation. The Maryland Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights played an active role in this process publishing a number of reports in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>African-American women who experienced the burden of both racial and gender discrimination saw progress with the passage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Pay_Act_of_1963">Equal Pay Act of 1963</a>and new protection against gender discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   The National Historic Landmarks program described the Civil Rights Act of 1964, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Considered the most comprehensive civil rights legislation in U.S. history, the act granted the federal government strong enforcement powers in the area of civil rights. It prohibited tactics to limit voting; guaranteed racial and religious minorities equal access to public accommodations; outlawed job discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; continued the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; and established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.    At the national level, this period began with the passage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> landmark legislation that outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The new policy made racially segregated public accommodations, discriminatory application of voter registration requirements, and segregated schools all illegal under federal law. Unlike several other southern states, Maryland’s elected Congressional representatives supported the law (with the exception of Rep. Richard Lankford (D) of Maryland 5th District on the Eastern Shore who voted “present”).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next year, Congress passed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> with most of Maryland’s representatives supporting the bill and only a single Maryland Congressman, Rogers Morton, MD 1st, not voting. The new law was created to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>At the state level, the Maryland State Assembly had passed the Fair Employment Act in 1965 and a bill supporting open housing in 1967. The 1967 was defeated by referendum but support came with new open housing requirements for home financing in 1968.</p>

Gay Street reflecting a new commitment to move into the “ghetto,” what they termed “the awakening giant.” In 1966, CORE selected Baltimore as its first “Target City” and spoke of “’igniting East Baltimore’s vast, gritty Negro ghetto in ’one big push against a segregationist, racist backwater, the worst in the nation.”</p>

<p>Union for Jobs or Income Now (U-JOIN) was a poverty fighting organization with offices located at 1061 N. Gay Street that on occasion worked with CORE in the 1960s. The organization, led by activist Walter Lively, helped establish the city’s first welfare rights organization, Mother Rescuers from Poverty, in 1966, and organized rent strikes that led to the creation of Tenants for Justice in Housing. In January 1968, U-JOIN sponsored a talk by Stokely Carmichael at Morgan State College.</p>

<p>In Baltimore, the city issued a directive ending the long-standing policy of segregated bars on June 23, 1967. One of the most lasting legacies for Baltimore from the late 1960s, was the unrest that followed the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King in April 1968.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">1968 – 1976</h1>
<p>The growing influence of Civil Rights movement, and key legal challenges to “Jim Crow” policies in Maryland and around the country in the 1940s and 1950s, led to even more significant change in the 1960s. Unfortunately, this period also saw the persistence of racist responses to black efforts to secure justice and opportunity, responses often discussed in terms of a “white backlash” that has lasting influence on the city and the region.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://mccr.maryland.gov/aboutmccr.html">Commission summarizes their history</a> between 1969 and 1977, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to the national Civil Rights Movement and the breaking down of numerous barriers, the Maryland General Assembly and Governor established the Commission on Human Relations in 1969 (Chapter 83 of 1968).  This was the first time that the Commission was allotted a budget for paid staff.  By Chapter 153 of 1969, the Commission was empowered to initiate and investigate complaints of discrimination in State agencies. The 1974 General Assembly made further amendments to the law.  Discrimination in housing on the bases of marital status and sex were prohibited, and exceptions were provided with respect to the application of certain provisions in the Discrimination in Housing subtitle (Chapter 848 of 1974).  A second bill provided that it was unlawful for persons and organizations to discriminate in certain employment practices against persons who were mentally or physically handicapped, to prohibit certain discriminatory activities against the physically or mentally handicapped in housing or obtaining loans on dwellings, and to make technical corrections to the language (Chapter 601 of 1974).  A parallel bill prohibited discriminatory activities in public accommodations, employment, and housing because of marital status or physical or mental handicaps, and clarifying the language of the law (Chapter 875 of 1974). By Chapter 419 of 1975, the Commission was permitted to seek certain types of court relief; namely, a temporary injunction if the Commission believed the appropriate civil action is necessary to preserve the status of the parties or to prevent irreparable harm.  Chapter 333 of 1975 provided that it was lawful for employers to establish standards concerning an employee’s dress and grooming standards if the standards were directly related to the nature of the employment. Chapters 937, 907, and 706 of 1977 were important changes that set the Commission on the track to its modern composition.  Chapter 937 of 1977 reduced the size of the Commission from twelve (12) members to nine (9), empowered the Commission to designate its own chair person, and abolished the previous $16,000 salary for the Chairperson.  The new legislation continued the appointment of the Executive Director by the Governor, but provided that he must choose from a list of five names submitted by the Commission, and also provided for the Executive Director’s removal by the Governor upon recommendation of two-thirds of the members of the Commission.  The authority to appoint and remove the Deputy Director and the General Counsel was transferred from the Governor to the Executive Director with approval by the majority of the Commission members.  The law also authorized the appointment of hearing examiners to hear cases under the Human Relations law, and provided for an appeal from the decisions of the hearing examiner to the Commission.  Finally, the new legislation expanded the Commission’s power to order appropriate relief for victims of discrimination by empowering the Commission to award monetary relief, limited to two years back pay, to the victims of employment discrimination. Furthermore, Chapter 907 of 1977 required employers to treat disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy or childbirth in the same manner as they treat other disabilities; and by Chapter 706 of 1977, the procedures that the Commission must follow in processing employment discrimination complaints against State agencies were altered.</p>

<li>Fair Housing Act of 1968   From NHL Theme Study:   “With the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights struggled with an agenda rapidly expanding in scope, complexity, and controversy. The Commission’s work took on a national rather than a regional focus and concentrated on affirmative action and federal enforcement efforts.  As impressive gains were made in African American civil rights, the Commission addressed claims from an expanding array of newly mobilized social movements and civil rights constituencies for similar protections and remedies.5   The Civil Rights Act made the enforcement of school desegregation possible. Faced with the prospect of losing federal funding, school boards and local governments produced plans to integrate schools. Late in the 1960s and early in the 1970s, the Commission investigated African American education as well as the educational isolation of Hispanic schoolchildren, a legacy of segregation dating from the turn of the century, and recommended changes.   The act’s equal employment and other economic-opportunity features significantly affected minorities and women. The concept and practice of “affirmative action” significantly expanded the black middle class, although success was limited in breaking through “glass ceilings” in corporate ownerships and upper-management positions. In addition, the recurring “backlash” against affirmative action continued to leave most African Americans in a marginal economic position. In government, executive branch remedies for past discrimination included developing a federal contract workforce reflecting the minority and gender makeup of the labor pool.   Even with the passage of the Civil Rights Act, minorities continued to face voting restrictions. The Supreme Court had made it clear, at least since 1944, that the Fifteenth Amendment granting citizens voting rights could not be denied or abridged. Yet, it took another twenty years and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to provide the enforcement measures needed to protect African Americans and other minorities. The results were felt most significantly in the nation’s urban areas, as well as in the Deep South where voter registration soared and black municipal officials were elected in large numbers.  Many blacks gained control of local governments and paved the way for expanded political influence.   Late in the 1960s, the Black Power Movement advocated black pride, control over black institutions, and self-determination over integration. It began to replace the earlier strategy of nonviolent civil disobedience with a more militant and aggressive approach.”</li>
