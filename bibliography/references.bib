  abstract = {Baltimore motorists lire holding more 13-3 gasoline rationing cards, entitling them to extra allotments of gasoline, than arc held by motorists in lhe New England States, the District of Columbia, Delaware and many small communities along the Eastern seaboard, figures released.../abs\ensuremath{>}leased yesterday in Washington by the Office of Price Administralion revealed. On the other hand, the percentage of motorists using gas-ration 1 cards in each of the four other categories, A, B-I. B-2 and X, is less in Baltimore than in the districts surveyed, the 'Washington office reported. OPA Officials Sample Cards OPA officials sampled 1,486,806 ration cards from lhe dissimilar areas to determine how their preregislrallon cslimalcs were slacking up wilh lhe actual registration a week ago. This sampling survey was based on an estimated twenty per cent, of all lhe car owners in the tested areas and was considered "an adequate cross-section sample of the over-all registration of all motorists along the seaboard," by one OPA official. figures reveal Washington The of gas-ration these percentages cards held by the motorists: A cards. ............. 30.8 Per Cent. B-I cards............. 10.8 Per Cent. B-2 cnrds.. ........... ?.3 Per Cent. B-3 curd.. ........... 37.5 Per Cent. X cards. ............. 3.6 Per Cent. One OPA spokesman said the - t percentages were representative of the distribulion of the cards over all the seventeen Stales Io an eslimaled 8,000,00 molorisls affecled by gasoline ralioning. 51.2 Here Hold B-3 Cards The distribution of cards in lhe A classificalion substantiated the estimalcd one third of the motorists predicted by OPA officials. Class A users, by OPA rule arc car owners who use their cars for pleasure, or who drive less than six miles a day in connection with their work. They are entitled to twenty-one gallons of gasoline between May 15 and July 1, the firsl rationing period. By contrast, the Baltimore figures, based on registrations reported by the local OPA office, reveal the following approximate percentages: ? cnrds ............. 21.6 Per Cent. B-I cards............ 7.9 Per Cent. B-2 cards............ 10.2 Per Cent. B-3 cards............. 51.2 Per Cent. X cards.............. 9.0 Per Cent. From a comparison ot the two columns ;t --ould appear Baltimore motorists have not received a greater number of the conlrovcrsial X ratings than were received in other parts of the rationed area. Entitled To 57 Gallons Holders of X ration cards here are a fraction of a percentage un dor oilier localities. The greatest divergence in the percentages is noted in the B-3 rating. Here, in Baltimore. 51.2 pel cent, of the 135,610 molorisls hole: the cards while 37.5 per cent, is listed in the Washington survey. A B-3 rating, second only to the X rating in gasoline allowance to motorists, entities a holder to fiftyseven gallons of gasoline belwcen May 15 and July 1. In lhis group are placed all ,persons who drive an average of more than fourteen miles a day in carrying on their work or in commuting to and from their work. Called For Workers In Class X, holders are entitled to unlimited quantities of gasoline. This group is limited to ambulances, hearses, taxicabs. medical !and nursing professions, trucks, ofjficial Federal, State and municipal cars, and construction and repair vehicles rendering public services. Leo H. McCormick, Stale OPA administrator, said he did not be- lieve the great number of B-3 hold- ers represented any attempt of BaUimoreans Io get more than their just share of gasoline. "That class, B-3, is the one inlo which mosl nil of our war workers linvc been catalogued," said Mr. McCormick. "I don't believe anyone knows just how many war workers there are in Baltimore but they probably comprise lhe largcsl class of people using their automobiles in the rationing program. Averages May Swing "The difference between the Bal- timore figures and the Washington compilation may be attributable to our !urge industrial area here and lhe lack of similar areas in the sampling. Perhaps, when the over all picture is completed, with lhe figures from Philadelphia and New York city, which are not Included, compiled, the averages will change with a swing to the B-3 class." Only. large city included in the sampling was Boston. Mr. McCormick again said he fell some motorists, through mis understanding and no willful de- jccption, were incorrectly classified into the larger registration classes Cards Still Being Returned Hc reported there still was ? steady stream of motorisls coming {[}Ho the regional office here and securing cards entitling them to csscr quantities of gasoline, thus relinquishing their X and B-3 .atings. Washington officials reported the same procedure was occurring hroughout the ralloncd area and f continued, may make some changes in the final percentages. Mr. McCormick encourage motorists to come to the regiona] office if they believed they were in correctly classified, assuring them hey would be spared any cm in relinquishing jarrassmcnt card entitling them Io a large quan lily ot gasoline for a smaller amount. Tire Study Is Made While the excitement over gaso inc rationing in Baltimore was simmering down, a sludy of ralion cards in respect Io lire use was made, revealing that if Baltimore ioldcrs of cards from A to B-; cover lhe maximum mileage possi ble with the fuel available Io lhem hey will wear out twenty-four times the number of new tire available on the basis of Maryland's May quota. Exclusive of the holders of lhe coveled X cards, holders of lhe Our oilier classes of cards arc en litled to purchase 5.554,979 gallon: of gasoline to June 30. Taking an average of 15 mile: to a gallon of gasoline it will pci mil the 123.403 holders of A and B ration cards to travel 83,324,158, miles. Will Wear Out 11,000 Tires If the holders of., these fou classes of cards use all the gasolin to which they arc entillcd, Ihej will cover 333,298,740 tire miles. Assuming a new tire will give 30 000 miles' of travel, it means tha in lhe first seven weeks of gas ra lioning, BaUimoreans will wear ou no less lhan 11,000 tires. They will use up approximate! seven per cent, or one-fifteenth ? the mileage left in their tires a the beginning of lhe period and a its end will find themselves tha much tire-poorer.

Kenneth Jackson's important book revises conventional wisdom about the Klan. He shows that its roots in the 1920s can also be found in burgeoning cities among people who were frightened, dislocated, and uprooted by rapid changes in urban life. Many joined the Klan for sincere patriotic motives, unaware of the ugly prejudice that lay beneath the civic rhetoric. Mr. Jackson not only dissects the Klan's activities and membership, he also traces its impact on the public life of the twenties. In many places from Atlanta to Dallas, from Buffalo to Portland, Oregon the Klan agitated politics, held immense power, and won elective office. The Ku Klux Klan in the City is a continuing and timely reminder of the tensions and antagonisms beneath the surface of our national life.

But few people are aware of his formative experiences in the two decades following World War II, as a white professor teaching at black colleges and as an activist in the civil rights movement. This volume brings together sixteen of his essays written between 1945 and 1965. Meier has added a substantial introduction, reflecting on those years and setting the context in which the essays were written. John H. Bracey, Jr., contributes an afterword which speaks to the uniqueness of Meier's experience among historians of African-American studies. The essays range from an analysis of the work of black sociologists in the twentieth century to an examination of race relations at predominantly black colleges in the 1950s, to case studies of nonviolent direct action in which Meier participated during the early 1960s. Of particular interest is an account of his debate with Malcolm X at Morgan State College in 1962, in which Malcolm X made the case for black nationalism and Meier defended the integrationist position. Collected for the first time, these essays provide a novel perspective on the early years of the civil rights movement and on the experience of historically black colleges such as Tougaloo, Fisk, and Morgan State.},

  abstract = {Baltimore has a long, colorful history that traditionally has been focused on famous men, social elites, and patriotic events. The Baltimore Book is both a history of "the other Baltimore" and a tour guide to places in the city that are important to labor, African American, and women's history. The book grew out of a popular local bus tour conducted by public historians, the People's History Tour of Baltimore, that began in 1982. This book records and adds sites to that tour; provides maps, photographs, and contemporary documents; and includes interviews with some of the uncelebrated people whose experiences as Baltimoreans reflect more about the city than Francis Scott Key ever did.The tour begins at the B\&O Railroad Station at Camden Yards, site of the railroad strike of 1877, moves on to Hampden-Woodbury, the mid-19th century cotton textile industry's company town, and stops on the way to visit Evergreen House and to hear the narratives of ex-slaves. We travel to Old West Baltimore, the late 19th-century center of commerce and culture for the African American community; Fells Point; Sparrows Point; the suburbs; Federal Hill; and Baltimore's "renaissance" at Harborplace. Interviews with community activists, civil rights workers, Catholic Workers, and labor union organizers bring color and passion to this historical tour. Specific labor struggles, class and race relations, and the contributions of women to Baltimore's development are emphasized at each stop.

This jobs boycott movement was a crucial moment in the resuscitation of the Baltimore Black freedom movement during the early years of the Great Depression and, in fact, helped to construct the foundations of the modern Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s in that city. The Baltimore movement was also a key event in a national wave of African-American jobs boycotts-a wave that was an important, but often ignored, facet of the freedom struggle across the United States in the 1930s. In addition to telling the inner story of the Baltimore boycott movement, this article examines how this movement emerged from and transformed the local political culture of Black Baltimore; investigates the role of national forces on this movement; raises some question about the functioning of race, ethnicity, gender, and class in the context on this movement; and suggests framework to interpret Depression-era African-American jobs boycotts in other cities.},

By the beginning of the 1955 school year, leaders had implemented a desegregation plan, and Baltimore was being applauded for the early and peaceful integration of its public schools. Within a few years, however, the praise faded as it became clear that Baltimore still suffered from de facto segregation. Faced with this reality, the school board refused to take the steps necessary to remedy the problem, instead shifting the blame to society at large. This failure by the board started a pattern of abandonment by school leadership that culminated in 1991 with the privatization of several of Baltimore's public schools. The result of this abandonment is a crippled school system that still has not dealt with issues of race and equality.},

Nevertheless, from early 1930 on the Baltimore section of the Communist Party energetically took up a steady struggle against white supremacy in its unemployment and trade union work, during its interventions in the local Black freedom movement, and in its cultural practices. Although small in size, the Baltimore party disrupted the tense social calm that had prevailed in the wake of the crash, stimulated interracial resistance to the effects of the crisis, and catalyzed a variety of new social movements that were inherently anti-racist. Contrary to prevailing historiographical wisdom, the ultra-radical third-period approach of the international communist movement was a definite asset to Baltimore communists, although the weaknesses of this approach ultimately limited their gains and legacies.},

  abstract = {Written by leading scholars of African American and women's history, the essays in this volume seek to reconceptualize the political history of black women in the United States by placing them "at the center of our thinking." The book explores how slavery, racial discrimination, and gender shaped the goals that African American women set for themselves, their families, and their race and looks at the political tools at their disposal. By identifying key turning points for black women, the essays create a new chronology and a new paradigm for historical analysis. The chronology begins in 1837 with the interracial meeting of antislavery women in New York City and concludes with the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  The contributors focus on specific examples of women pursuing a dual ambition: to gain full civil and political rights and to improve the social conditions of African Americans. Together, the essays challenge us to rethink common generalizations that govern much of our historical thinking about the experience of African American women.  Contributors include Bettina Aptheker, Elsa Barkley Brown, Willi Coleman, Gerald R. Gill, Ann D.

Farrar examines how the "Afro-American" grew and prospered as a newspaper and as a business. How and why the "Afro-American" conducted its news and editorial crusades for a powerful local and national black community free of racial disabilities is discussed as well. He also evaluates whether or not the "Afro-American" succeeded or failed in its racial justice campaigns and to what extent these campaigns made a difference in the local and national black communities' struggle for racial equity. He asserts that the "Afro-American" was a black middle-class institution that wanted to shape its community according to bourgeois values, but it also broke ground by looking at class issues in the early 20th-century black community.},

  isbn = {978-0-691-00947-6},
  shorttitle = {Standing {{Soldiers}}, {{Kneeling Slaves}}},
  abstract = {The United States of America originated as a slave society, holding millions of Africans and their descendants in bondage, and remained so until a civil war took the lives of a half million soldiers, some once slaves themselves. Standing Soldiers, Kneeling Slaves explores how that history of slavery and its violent end was told in public space--specifically in the sculptural monuments that increasingly came to dominate streets, parks, and town squares in nineteenth-century America. Here Kirk Savage shows how the greatest era of monument building in American history arose amidst struggles over race, gender, and collective memory. As men and women North and South fought to define the war's legacy in monumental art, they reshaped the cultural landscape of American nationalism.  At the same time that the Civil War challenged the nation to reexamine the meaning of freedom, Americans began to erect public monuments as never before. Savage studies this extraordinary moment in American history when a new interracial order seemed to be on the horizon, and when public sculptors tried to bring that new order into concrete form. Looking at monuments built and unbuilt, Savage shows how an old image of black slavery was perpetuated while a new image of the common white soldier was launched in public space. Faced with the challenge of Reconstruction, the nation ultimately recast itself in the mold of the ordinary white man.  Standing Soldiers, Kneeling Slaves, the first sustained investigation of monument building as a process of national and racial definition, probes a host of fascinating questions: How was slavery to be explained without exploding the myth of a "united" people? How did notions of heroism become racialized? And more generally, who is represented in and by monumental space? How are particular visions of history constructed by public monuments? Written in an engaging fashion, this book will appeal to a wide range of readers interested in American culture, race relations, and public art.},

  shorttitle = {Imperfect {{Equality}}},
  abstract = {In Imperfect Equality, Richard Fuke has explores the immediate aftermath of slavery in Maryland, which differed in important ways from the slaveholding states of the South: it never left the Union; white radicals had a period of access to power; and even prior to legal emancipation, a large free black population resided there. Moreover, the presence of Baltimore, a major city and port, provided abundant evidence with which to compare the rural and the urban experience of black Marylanders. This state study is therefore uniquely revealing of the successes and failures of the post-emancipation period. The transition in Maryland from a slave to a free society, Fuke argues, presented to black Marylanders opportunities to achieve previously inaccessible goals. Blacks were able to realize some goals, such as greater land ownership, control over the labor of their children, education, and the formation of independent cultural and social organizations, through their own intrepidity combined with the support of white radicals as well as with the assistance of the Freedmen's Bureau, the United States Army, and some state-controlled agencies. Other goals-such as social equality, economic opportunity and advancement, and suffrage-remained beyond the reach of blacks, not only because of conservative white opposition, but also, Fuke argues, because of the attitudinal limitations of white radicals unable to confront the full range of post-emancipation possibilities. Calling upon a very broad range of sources, Fuke demonstrates that after emancipation, Black Marylanders neither enjoyed total freedom nor suffered absolute coercion, but their struggle made two things clear: much of whatever they might accomplish, they would have to do by themselves; and such efforts would remain confined by white attitudes determined to regulate them.},

  abstract = {“Pulling together the threads of philanthropy, religion, race, and the lives of working single men in Baltimore, Jessica Elfenbein examines the powerful role of voluntary organizations in shaping modern America.”—Darwin H. Stapleton, Rockefeller Archive Center“A useful study . . . containing a great deal of important material on the Baltimore YMCA, its founders, the work it did for 80 years, and the benefits of that work for the community.”—Barry D. Karl, Harvard UniversityThis compelling story of a city and one of its key institutions affords a revealing perspective on urban modernity in the making. It challenges some of today's prevailing views on the nature and relations of America's religious institutions, as well as its public and nonprofit sectors, especially in light of recent initiatives to integrate religious groups into federally funded welfare programs.Combining urban and social history, this study of the Baltimore YMCA explores the relationships among religion, government, business, and nonprofit organizations in the development of an important industrial American city and reveals how race, masculinity, ethnicity, private institutions, and religious sensibility have influenced modern American culture.~From the 1850s to the 1930s, the Baltimore YMCA helped to shape a modern city and its approach to social welfare. Motivated by religious faith, civic need, and community service, its leaders set out to address the domestic, educational, recreational, and vocational issues most critical to the well-being of their targeted audience—young Christian men of (or aspiring to) the middle class. The YMCA leadership, black and white, identified and worked to correct community-wide problems in such areas as education, housing, and poverty.~Fueled by its ties to Johns Hopkins University, the Baltimore YMCA was an important incubator of people and ideas that shaped charitable activity in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Levering Hall, the campus YMCA at Hopkins, in partnership with the Charity Organization Society, nurtured the careers of men like John R. Commons, Richard T. Ely, and the Flexner brothers, greatly influencing the landscape of modern philanthropy and social welfare.Jessica I. Elfenbein is the director of the Center for Baltimore Studies and assistant professor of history at the University of Baltimore. She is the author of Civics, Commerce, and Community: The History of the Greater Washington Board of Trade, 1889-1999, and of a forthcoming study of the role of faith-based organizations in national urban revitalization efforts.},

  title = {The {{Communist Party}} in {{Maryland}}, 1919-57},
  isbn = {978-0-252-02321-7},
  abstract = {This rare grass-roots account of American communism traces the rise and fall of Maryland's Communist Party from the time of the Russian Revolution to the McCarthy era. Drawing on sources including the central archives of the Communist Party of the United States of America, recovered from remote storage in Siberia in 1993, Vernon L. Pedersen presents a sharp challenge to revisionist views of American communism as a benign domestic movement detached from Soviet interests. Bolsheviks in Baltimore charts the uneven transformation of Baltimore's fledgling Communists into underground revolutionaries in the 1920s. Pedersen documents the mercurial careers of local organizers, their devotion to the Soviet cause, and their efforts to convert the Party from a hodgepodge of ethnic groups to an effective instrument of class interests. He also tracks the public's changing perception of the Communists, from amused unconcern to alarm, and details how the Ober antisubversive law and the HUAC hearings of the 1950s dismantled the Party from without while planting seeds of paranoia that destroyed it from within. Behind the public fear of a Communist conspiracy against the U.S. government, Pedersen fin acting on Soviet orders, used their influence in unions and front groups to sway American foreign policy in ways that benefited the Soviet Union. He documents the consolidation of an espionage apparatus in Baltimore and demonstrates that while espionage activities may have involved only a few individuals, all Party members shared an attitude of willing support for the activities of the Soviet Union that made these covert practices possible. Paying tribute to the fervor and the effort dedicated by the Maryland Communists, often at the expense of their own physical and financial well-being, to a cause that ultimately failed them, Bolsheviks in Baltimore assesses an ambiguous legacy of admirable social vision, haphazard international conspiracy, and fierce internal conflict.},

Along the way he provides interesting details about the politics of downtown development in the Marion Barry era of Washington, DC. Mitchell calls for a bold and inclusive "New (Black) Urbanism." He sees the radical reform and "re-missioning" of the handful of accredited HBCU based architecture schools as a critical tool in refashioning a rapprochement between black architects and Black America.},

Lion in the Lobby chronicles Mitchell's life story and mission of getting the Congress to join the courts and the Executive Branch in upholding the Constitution in order to fulfill the NAACP's egalitarian philosophy. He worked with seven presidents, from Harry Truman to Jimmy Carter, to build a legacy of advocacy that won him the popular moniker of 101st senator and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1978.

  abstract = {This richly illustrated collection of fourteen essays examines the ways in which Confederate memorials - from Monument Avenue to Stone Mountain - and the public rituals surrounding them testify to the tenets of the Lost Cause, a romanticized narrative of the war. Several essays highlight the creative leading role played by women's groups in memorialization, while others explore the alternative ways in which people outside white southern culture wrote their very different histories on the southern landscape. The authors - who include Richard Guy Wilson, Catherine W. Bishir, W. Fitzhugh Brundage, and William M.S. Ramussen - trace the origins, objectives, and changing consequences of Confederate monuments over time and the dynamics of individuals and organizations that sponsored them. Thus these essays extend the growing literature on the rhetoric of the Lost Cause by shifting the focus to the realm of the visual. They are especially relevant in the present day when Confederate symbols and monuments continue to play a central role in a public - and often emotionally charged - debate about how the South's past should be remembered.  The editors: Art Historian Cynthia Mills, a specialist in nineteenth-century public sculpture, is executive editor of American Art, the scholarly journal of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

  abstract = {Black women have traditionally represented the canvas on which many debates about poverty and welfare have been drawn. For a quarter century after the publication of the notorious Moynihan report, poor black women were tarred with the same brush: "ghetto moms" or "welfare queens" living off the state, with little ambition or hope of an independent future. At the same time, the history of the civil rights movement has all too often succumbed to an idolatry that stresses the centrality of prominent leaders while overlooking those who fought daily for their survival in an often hostile urban landscape. In this collective biography, Rhonda Y. Williams takes us behind, and beyond, politically expedient labels to provide an incisive and intimate portrait of poor black women in urban America. Drawing on dozens of interviews, Williams challenges the notion that low-income housing was a resounding failure that doomed three consecutive generations of post-war Americans to entrenched poverty. Instead, she recovers a history of grass-roots activism, of political awakening, and of class mobility, all facilitated by the creation of affordable public housing. The stereotyping of black women, especially mothers, has obscured a complicated and nuanced reality too often warped by the political agendas of both the left and the right, and has prevented an accurate understanding of the successes and failures of government anti-poverty policy. At long last giving human form to a community of women who have too often been treated as faceless pawns in policy debates, Rhonda Y. Williams offers an unusually balanced and personal account of the urban war on poverty from the perspective of those who fought, and lived, it daily.},

In this oral memoir, Williams identifies the essential elements of sound education and describes the battles she waged to secure those elements, first as teacher, then a counselor, and, for twenty-five years, as principal. She also described her own education - growing up black in largely white Germantown, Pennsylvania; studying black history and culture for the first time at Cheyney State Teachers College; and meeting the rigorous demands of the program which she graduated from in 1949. In retracing her career, Williams examines the highs and lows of urban public education since World War II. She is at once an outspoken critic and spirited advocate of the system to which she devoted her life.},

For example, people tend to shy away from parks with a history of racial violence or segregation even after the problem no longer exists. Baltimore’s Carroll Park provides an excellent example of an urban green space with a long history of different policies regarding who could be granted access to the park facilities. From its beginnings as a wealthy estate owned by the Carroll Family, the land being studied here passed into the hands of the private, German-run West Baltimore Schuetzen Association, and later into the possession of the City of Baltimore as what we now know as Carroll Park. Though designed with the Olmsted vision of green space access for all, many facilities in Carroll Park remained segregated until the 1950’s. Through detailing the history of the German and Segregation eras of Carroll Park, this thesis will help to contribute to the study of how Baltimore’s current patterns of park access and use came to be.},

  abstract = {This article looks at the debates surrounding Baltimore's 1910 Segregation Ordinance in transnational context. It asks whether the beliefs and actions of Baltimore's segregationists were connected to those deployed in hundreds of other efforts to segregate cities by race worldwide-in Asia, Africa, Australasia, and elsewhere in the Americas--during the same period. Using a comparison focussed on India, South Africa and the U.S., it argues that three interconnected and transnationally traded political conversations--concerning conflict between races "commingled" in the same geographic areas; concerning solutions of urban problems; and concerning middle-class control of urban property markets--were critical to urban segregationist discourse in places with otherwise very different histories. Because of local and national conditions, including well-organized black resistance, supporters of Baltimore's Ordinance drew on some of these languages more than others. Their heavy reliance on the argument that blacks threatened white property values was typical of the politics of America's "marketized" form of segregation, which threatens to become a transnational export in its own right. The paper seeks to use closely textured social-historical research and a wide-ranging synthetic reading of the history of cities elsewhere in the world as a means to understand and document world-historical phenomena.},

  abstract = {By the 1960s, the urban crisis in the United States was well underway. Structural transformations in the postwar economy and accelerating deindustrialization contributed to high rates of unemployment in many cities in the nation's old industrial core. During the 1970s and 1980s, the urban crisis worsened. This article argues that the macroeconomic policies of Presidents Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan fueled urban decline. Responding to the waning hegemony of the United States in the global economy as well as to a domestic corporate crisis of profitability, the presidents pursued macroeconomic agendas that prioritized the revitalization of American economic dominance. Macroeconomic policy decisions in combination with white-backlash pressures constrained the range of urban policies the presidents could pursue and often compelled privatization. The federal-level decisionmaking had devastating consequences in Baltimore, Maryland, the city discussed in this article. The macroeconomic and urban policies had racialized and gendered outcomes that plunged the city into the most acute phase of the urban crisis.},

  shorttitle = {Here {{Lies Jim Crow}}},
  abstract = {Though he lived throughout much of the South—and even worked his way into parts of the North for a time—Jim Crow was conceived and buried in Maryland. From Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney’s infamous decision in the Dred Scott case to Thurgood Marshall’s eloquent and effective work on Brown v. Board of Education, the battle for black equality is very much the story of Free State women and men. Here, Baltimore Sun columnist C. Fraser Smith recounts that tale through the stories, words, and deeds of famous, infamous, and little-known Marylanders. He traces the roots of Jim Crow laws from Dred Scott to Plessy v. Ferguson and describes the parallel and opposite early efforts of those who struggled to establish freedom and basic rights for African Americans. Following the historical trail of evidence, Smith relates latter-day examples of Maryland residents who trod those same steps, from the thrice-failed attempt to deny black people the vote in the early twentieth century to nascent demonstrations for open access to lunch counters, movie theaters, stores, golf courses, and other public and private institutions—struggles that occurred decades before the now-celebrated historical figures strode onto the national civil rights scene. Smith's lively account includes the grand themes and the state’s major players in the movement—Frederick Douglass, Harriett Tubman, Thurgood Marshall, and Lillie May Jackson, among others—and also tells the story of the struggle via several of Maryland’s important but relatively unknown men and women—such as Gloria Richardson, John Prentiss Poe, William L. "Little Willie" Adams, and Walter Sondheim—who prepared Jim Crow’s grave and waited for the nation to deliver the body.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Baltimore Elite Giants}}},
  abstract = {One of the best-known teams in the old Negro Leagues, the Elite Giants of Baltimore featured some of the outstanding African American players of the day. Sociologist and baseball writer Bob Luke narrates the untold story of the team and its interaction with the city and its people during the long years of segregation.To convey a sense of the action on the field and the major events in the team’s history, Luke highlights important games, relives the standout performances of individual players, and discusses key decisions made by management. He introduces the team’s eventual major league stars: Roy Campanella, who went on to a ten-year Hall of Fame career with the Brooklyn Dodgers; Joe Black, the first African American pitcher to win a World Series game; and James "Junior" Gilliam, a player and coach with the Dodgers for twenty-five years. Luke also describes the often contentious relationship between the team and major league baseball before, during, and after the major leagues were integrated.The Elite Giants did more than provide entertainment for Baltimore’s black residents; the team and its star players broke the color barrier in the major leagues, giving hope to an African American community still oppressed by Jim Crow. In recounting the history of the Elite Giants, Luke reveals how the team, its personalities, and its fans raised public awareness of the larger issues faced by blacks in segregation-era Baltimore. Based on interviews with former players and Baltimore residents, articles from the black press of the time, and archival documents, and illustrated with previously unpublished photographs, The Baltimore Elite Giants recounts a barrier-breaking team’s successes, failures, and eventual demise.},

  shorttitle = {Infectious {{Fear}}},
  abstract = {For most of the first half of the twentieth century, tuberculosis ranked among the top three causes of mortality among urban African Americans. Often afflicting an entire family or large segments of a neighborhood, the plague of TB was as mysterious as it was fatal. Samuel Kelton Roberts Jr. examines how individuals and institutions--black and white, public and private--responded to the challenges of tuberculosis in a segregated society. Reactionary white politicians and health officials promoted "racial hygiene" and sought to control TB through Jim Crow quarantines, Roberts explains. African Americans, in turn, protested the segregated, overcrowded housing that was the true root of the tuberculosis problem. Moderate white and black political leadership reconfigured definitions of health and citizenship, extending some rights while constraining others. Meanwhile, those who suffered with the disease--as its victims or as family and neighbors--made the daily adjustments required by the devastating effects of the "white plague."Exploring the politics of race, reform, and public health, Infectious Fear uses the tuberculosis crisis to illuminate the limits of racialized medicine and the roots of modern health disparities. Ultimately, it reveals a disturbing picture of the United States' health history while offering a vision of a more democratic future.},

Our work, lauded in the national press, received the National Council on Public History's Outstanding Project and the American Association of State and Local History's Award of Merit and 2009 WOW Award. We believe this kind of history, different from popular booster narratives, is a model for public history projects.

However, very little is known about the characteristics of these neighborhoods and of the residents who live in them. With data taken from a larger study of an integrated neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland, this article discusses homeowners' perceptions of their community and racial integration. Fifty semi-structured interviews were completed with 67 homeowners to investigate their perceptions and experiences of race, class, and change in their community. This study shows that statistical racial integration and perceptions of racial integration are two different factors. Residents define true racial integration as both residential and social. As a result, homeowners reported that their neighborhood is both segregated and integrated — a type of "qualified" integration. Perceptions of racial integration are also affected by inconsistently defined neighborhood boundaries and racial clustering, block by block.},

Such discrepancies, Hilary Moss argues, suggest that white opposition to black education was not a foregone conclusion. Through the comparative lenses of these three cities, she shows why opposition erupted where it did across the United States during the same period that gave rise to public education. As common schooling emerged in the 1830s, providing white children of all classes and ethnicities with the opportunity to become full-fledged citizens, it redefined citizenship as synonymous with whiteness. This link between school and American identity, Moss argues, increased white hostility to black education at the same time that it spurred African Americans to demand public schooling as a means of securing status as full and equal members of society. Shedding new light on the efforts of black Americans to learn independently in the face of white attempts to withhold opportunity, Schooling Citizens narrates a previously untold chapter in the thorny history of America’s educational inequality.},

  abstract = {Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.  Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.  Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia—a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo—to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.  Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family—past and present—is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.  Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance?~ ~~~~~~~~~~ Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.},

  abstract = {Jo Ann Argersinger's innovative analysis of the New Deal years in Baltimore establishes the significance of citizen participation and community organization in shaping the welfare programs of the Great Depression. Baltimore, a border city divided by race and openly hostile to unions, the unemployed, and working women, is a particularly valuable locus for gauging the impact of the New Deal.This book examines the interaction of federal, state, and local policies, and documents the partial efforts of the New Deal to reach out to new constituencies. By unraveling the complex connections between government intervention and citizen action, Argersinger offers new insights into the real meaning of the Roosevelt record. She demonstrates how New Deal programs both encouraged and restricted the organized efforts of groups traditionally ignored by major party politics. With federal assistance, Baltimore's blacks, women, unionizing workers, and homeless unemployed attempted to combat local conservatism and make the New Deal more responsive to their needs. Ultimately, citizen activism was as important as federal legislation in determining the contours of the New Deal in Baltimore.Originally published in 1988.A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print.

  abstract = {In 1968, Baltimore was home to a variety of ethnic, religious, and racial communities that, like those in other American cities, were confronting a quickly declining industrial base. In April of that year, disturbances broke the urban landscape along lines of race and class.This book offers chapters on events leading up to the turmoil, the riots, and the aftermath as well as four rigorously edited and annotated oral histories of members of the Baltimore community. The combination of new scholarship and first-person accounts provides a comprehensive case study of this period of civil unrest four decades later.This engaging, broad-based public history lays bare the diverse experiences of 1968 and their effects, emphasizing the role of specific human actions. By reflecting on the stories and analysis presented in this anthology, readers may feel empowered to pursue informed, responsible civic action of their own.Baltimore '68 is the book component of a larger public history project, "Baltimore '68 Riots: Riots and Rebirth." The project's companion website (http://archives.ubalt.edu/bsr/index.html ) offers many more oral histories plus photos, art, and links to archival sources. The book and the website together make up an invaluable teaching resource on cities, social unrest, and racial politics in the 1960s. The project was the corecipient of the 2009 Outstanding Public History Project Award from the National Council on Public History.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Catonsville Nine}}},
  abstract = {On May 17th, 1968, a group of Catholic antiwar activists burst into a draft board in suburban Baltimore, stole hundreds of Selective Service records (which they called "death certificates"), and burned the documents in a fire fueled by homemade napalm. The bold actions of the ''Catonsville Nine'' quickly became international news and captured headlines throughout the summer and fall of 1968 when the activists, defended by radical attorney William Kunstler, were tried in federal court. In The Catonsville Nine, Shawn Francis Peters, a Catonsville native, offers the first comprehensive account of this key event in the history of 1960's protest. While thousands of supporters thronged the streets outside the courthouse, the Catonsville Nine--whose ranks included activist priests Philip and Daniel Berrigan--delivered passionate indictments of the war in Vietnam and the brutality of American foreign policy. The proceedings reached a stirring climax, as the nine activists led the entire courtroom (the judge and federal prosecutors included) in the Lord's Prayer. Peters gives readers vivid, blow-by-blow accounts of the draft raid, the trial, and the ensuing manhunt for the Berrigans, George Mische, and Mary Moylan, who went underground rather than report to prison. He also examines the impact of Daniel Berrigan's play, The Trial of the Catonsville Nine, and the larger influence of this remarkable act of civil disobedience. More than 40 years after they stormed the draft board, the Catonsville Nine are still invoked by both secular and religious opponents of militarism. Based on a wealth of sources, including archival documents, the activists' previously unreleased FBI files, and a variety of eyewitness accounts, The Catonsville Nine tells a story as relevant and instructive today as it was in 1968.},

  shorttitle = {Young {{Thurgood}}},
  abstract = {Thurgood Marshall was the most important American lawyer of the twentieth century. He transformed the nation's legal landscape by challenging the racial segregation that had relegated millions to second-class citizenship. He won twenty-nine of thirty-three cases before the United States Supreme Court, was a federal appeals court judge, served as the US solicitor general, and, for twenty-four years, sat on the Supreme Court. Marshall is best known for achievements after he relocated to New York in 1936 to work for the NAACP. But Marshall's personality, attitudes, priorities, and work habits had crystallized during earlier years in Maryland. This work is the first close examination of the formative period in Marshall's life. As the authorn shows, Thurgood Marshall was a fascinating man of contrasts. He fought for racial justice without becoming a racist. Simultaneously idealistic and pragmatic, Marshall was a passionate advocate, yet he maintained friendly relationships with his opponents. Young Thurgood reveals how Marshall's distinctive traits were molded by events, people, and circumstances early in his life. Professor Gibson presents fresh information about Marshall's family, youth, and education. He describes Marshall's key mentors, the special impact of his high school and college competitive debating, his struggles to establish a law practice during the Great Depression, and his first civil rights cases. The author sheds new light on the NAACP and its first lawsuits in the campaign that led to the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation decision. He also corrects some of the often-repeated stories about Marshall that are inaccurate.The only biography of Thurgood Marshall to be endorsed by Marshall’s immediate family, Young Thurgood is an exhaustively researched and engagingly written work that everyone interested in law, civil rights, American history, and biography will want to read.From the Hardcover edition.},

  abstract = {In A New Deal for All? Andor Skotnes examines the interrelationships between the Black freedom movement and the workers' movement in Baltimore and Maryland during the Great Depression and the early years of the Second World War. Adding to the growing body of scholarship on the long civil rights struggle, he argues that such "border state" movements helped resuscitate and transform the national freedom and labor struggles. In the wake of the Great Crash of 1929, the freedom and workers' movements had to rebuild themselves, often in new forms. In the early 1930s, deepening commitments to antiracism led Communists and Socialists in Baltimore to launch racially integrated initiatives for workers' rights, the unemployed, and social justice. An organization of radicalized African American youth, the City-Wide Young People's Forum, emerged in the Black community and became involved in mass educational, anti-lynching, and Buy Where You Can Work campaigns, often in multiracial alliances with other progressives. During the later 1930s, the movements of Baltimore merged into new and renewed national organizations, especially the CIO and the NAACP, and built mass regional struggles. While this collaboration declined after the war, Skotnes shows that the earlier cooperative efforts greatly shaped national freedom campaigns to come—including the civil rights movement.},

  abstract = {As a border city Baltimore made an ideal arena to push for change during the civil rights movement. It was a city in which all forms of segregation and racism appeared vulnerable to attack by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's methods. If successful in Baltimore, the rest of the nation might follow with progressive and integrationist reforms. The Baltimore branch of the NAACP was one of the first chapters in the nation and was the largest branch in the nation by 1946. The branch undertook various forms of civil rights activity from 1914 through the 1940s that later were mainstays of the 1960s movement. Nonviolent protest, youth activism, economic boycotts, marches on state capitols, campaigns for voter registration, and pursuit of anti-lynching cases all had test runs. Remarkably, Baltimore's NAACP had the same branch president for thirty-five years starting in 1935, a woman, Lillie M. Jackson. Her work highlights gender issues and the social and political transitions among the changing civil rights groups. In Borders of Equality, Lee Sartain evaluates her leadership amid challenges from radicalized youth groups and the Black Power Movement. Baltimore was an urban industrial center that shared many characteristics with the North, and African Americans could vote there. The city absorbed a large number of black economic migrants from the South, and it exhibited racial patterns that made it more familiar to Southerners. It was one of the first places to begin desegregating its schools in September 1954 after the Brown decision, and one of the first to indicate to the nation that race was not simply a problem for the Deep South. Baltimore's history and geography make it a perfect case study to examine the NAACP and various phases of the civil rights struggle in the twentieth century},

  abstract = {Scholarly research on African American based Mosques in Baltimore City is minute when compared to scholarly works done on African American based Churches. Masjid Al Haqq, which was previously called Mosque Six, has been a mainstay for African Americans seeking Islamic guidance in Baltimore City since 1956. The Mosque and its members had significant impact on economic, social, and political activities in Baltimore City. Adopting a narrative approach; this research investigates the ideological, economical, educational, political, and social activities of the Mosque and its members from 1956 to 1996. This thesis states that the change in ideology when the Mosque transitioned from Mosque Six to Masjid Al Haqq after the death of Elijah Muhammad significantly changed the daily operations of the Mosque. Warith Deen Muhammad, who took over the leadership of the NOI in 1975 after the death of Elijah Muhammad, wanted to change the direction of the NOI toward Orthodox Islam while some NOI members wanted to continue the teachings of Elijah Muhammad resulting in a split in the movement. The economical, educational, political, and social activities of the Mosque and its members were dictated by the Islamic doctrine adhered to by the national leader of the Islamic movement. Mosque members in the 1950s to 1970s were guided by the doctrines of Nation of Islam (NOI) while in the 1980s they were guided by the doctrines of the World Community of Al-Islam in the West (WCIW) under the leadership of Warith Deen Muhammad.},

It examines the NAACP’s efforts to eliminate racial discrimination and segregation in a city and state that was “neither North nor South”. Under the long-time leadership of Lillie Jackson, the branch grew into one of the largest and most successful branches of the Association. During her presidency, the branch facilitated the growth of the freedom struggle beyond Baltimore into other areas of Maryland, and its organizing efforts served as models by the national NAACP for freedom struggles in other areas of the South. In doing so, its ideas, tactics, strategies, and methods influenced the growth of the national civil rights movement.},

One emphasizes the successes of antibiotic therapy in the 1950s and 1960s, the subsequent decline in resources for tuberculosis management, and the resurgence of tuberculosis in the 1990s. The second centres on the development of the global DOTS strategy and privileges those aspects of earlier control efforts that appear to be precursors to DOTS. Both narratives underemphasize diverse efforts by public health authorities across the world to manage the possibilities and challenges of antibiotic therapy. These efforts were shaped by local social and political contexts. The history of Baltimore's tuberculosis control programme between 1950 and 1978 illustrates the complex array of strategies public health officials employed as well as the way they adapted strategies from other jurisdictions. It highlights continuities between the pre-antibiotic and the post-antibiotic history of tuberculosis, and ways that persistent racial tropes influenced tuberculosis control programmes.},

  abstract = {Life in a Black Community: Striving for Equal Citizenship in Annapolis, Maryland, 1902-1952 tells the story of a struggle over what it meant to be a citizen of a democracy. For blacks, membership in a democracy meant full and equal participation in the life of the town. For most whites, it meant the full participation of only its white citizens, based on the presumption that their black neighbors were less than equal citizens and had to be kept down. All the dramas of the Jim Crow era—lynching, the KKK, and disenfranchisement, but also black boycotts, petitioning for redress of grievances, lawsuits, and political activism—occurred in Annapolis. As they were challenging white prejudice and discrimination, tenacious black citizens advanced themselves and enriched their own world of churches, shops, clubs, and bars. It took grit for black families to survive. As they pressed on, life slowly improved—for some. Life in a Black Community recounts the tactics blacks used to gain equal rights, details the methods whites employed to deny or curtail their rights, and explores a range of survival and advancement strategies used by black families.},
