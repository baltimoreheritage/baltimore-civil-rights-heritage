# Introduction

In the 1840s, Baltimore’s narrow alley houses sheltered hundreds of enslaved people seeking freedom in the midst of the largest free black population in any southern city. In 1893, Edward H. Bouton, the influential developer of Roland Park and Guilford, explored the use of racially restrictive covenants – setting the model segregated suburban communities across the country. In 1910, Baltimore became the first city in the nation to make racial segregation part of local housing law. After World War II, quickly changing neighborhoods inspired interracial activist groups to push for neighborhood stabilization and expand organizing efforts around open housing.

Housing has long been an important factor in shaping the lives of Baltimore’s African American residents and is at the center of a number of key advocacy efforts during the 19th and 20th centuries. This study looks at the history of African American housing in Baltimore and the role of the Civil Rights movement in advocating for safe and decent housing, fighting for the right of African Americans to live where they chose, and working to preserve black households from demolition and displacement.

# 1831 – 1870

In _Freedom's Port: The African American Community of Baltimore, 1790-1860_  Christopher Phillips (p.100), commented on the precarious housing situation of Baltimore’s growing free black residents in the early 19th century:

> In 1790 over 43 percent of the 325 free blacks enumerated in the census resided in white household, working as domestics or indentured laborers. [...] For many free blacks, temporary residence in a white household in Baltimore provided only a transitional step between bondage and autonomy. [...] From 1790 to 1830 the number of free Negro households rose from 47 to 683, an increase of 1,353.2 percent, proportionately eve greater than the overall free black population increase of 1,123.7 percent during the same period.
> Of fourteen antebellum cities, Baltimore had the lowest percentage of [free black] property owners. Philadelphia had twice as many, and Charleston had three times as many, while only Washington witnessed a smaller average size of holdings than Baltimore's $1,327 in 1850. […] Free Negroes in Baltimore did not achieve autonomous living arrangements, whatever their condition and whether owned or rented, without cost to their standard of living. At the time more of them were finding independent housing, their dwellings became increasingly crowded. Between 1790 and 1830 the average size of individual free black households grew from just under four to just over six persons per household. Because Maryland tenant laws required renters to be responsible for a third of the taxes on property, the city's poor—both white and black—tended to live in tiny, squalid dwellings.[^1]

Christopher Phillips described the condition and location of free black housing in early 19th century Baltimore, writing:

> In the decades following 1810 a perceptible shift of residential patterns for thousands of free blacks occurred in Baltimore. As the commercial core of the city became an area made up almost exclusively of affluent white families, black and white laborers were pushed toward the periphery of the city. Although as late as 1810 nearly half of the city's free Negroes lived in the central wards, by 1830 less than 10 percent resided in that part of the city. The largest number moved to the western precincts, where developers had responded to the population boom by laying out new streets and erecting cheap tenement housing. The rest of the city's displaced free blacks relocated east of the commercial core, either across from Jones' Falls in Old Town, an area of the city where most were craftspeople and laborers, or into the narrow streets and alleys in and around Fells Point, where older, cheaper housing was merging with new row-house construction.[^2]

Phillips continued to note the concentration of black Baltimoreans along alleys:

> Unlike many cities in the Deep South, where high walls enclosed yards containing slave quarters (thus often precluding the incorporation of alleys into the municipal design), Baltimore had a maze of alleyways and court-yards in which most of the city's free blacks soon came to make their homes. [...] In 1820 such places as Happy Alley, Argyle Alley, Strawberry Alley, Petticoat Alley, Apple Alley in or near Fells Point; Union Alley and Liberty Alley in Old Town; Bottle Alley, Whiskey Alley, and Brandy Alley in the core city; and Welcome Alley, Waggon Alley, Dutch Alley, Sugar Alley, and Honey Alley just to the west of the central city and to the south of it in the Federal Hill area were lined with small row houses in which multiple free black and slave families lived.

Despite this concentration, the city was not wholly segregated, as Phillips noted:

> While alleys early on became predominantly black areas of residence in Baltimore, the city as a whole did not so quickly exhibit such segregation. [...] As in other southern cities, no legal segregation existed in antebellum Baltimore, and all residential streets (and even the alleys) had black family dwellings interspersed with those of laboring and poor whites.

## 1871: African American households in Baltimore grow to 12,000

In describing the growing African-American population following the Civil War, historian Richard Paul Fuke, observed in _Imperfect Equality_:

> Between 1860 and 1870, the United States Census reported a 42 percent growth in Baltimore’s black population from 27,898 to 39,558. Of the city’s 54,936 new arrivals during the decade, 11,660, or 21 percent, were black, an influx that raised the black percentage of the entire city population from 13 to 15. During the same period, the census reported a decline in the black population of all but one of the six rural counties in southern Maryland and in four of eight on the Eastern Shore. Contemporary observers estimated Baltimore’s black population to be even higher than what the census figures indicate. In December 1866, a Freedman’s Bureau officer claimed that blacks constituted 20 percent of the city’s residents, and in July 1867, the _Baltimore American_ placed the total at 44,400.

Fuke highlights the annual City Directories published by W.H. Woods as an important source:

> Between 1864 and 1871, the number of black householders listed in the _Woods’ City Directory_ tripled from 4,00 to 12,000. […] Some of Woods’s figures seem high compared to those of the United States Census, but his estimates compared favorably to other sources. The 1871 directory calculated Baltimore’s population to be approximately 300,000, a number higher than the census’s 267,354, but equal to many other assessments at the time.

Housing in post-Civil War Baltimore had difficulty keeping pace with the rapid growth in the city’s population, as Fuke noted:

> Within a month of emancipation, the Friends Association reported “many calls from women with children… who have neither food not shelter.” “We find more suffering than we are able to alleviate,” it added in January 1865, “They [are in] want of the most necessary food and clothing, and have crowded into alleys and callers.”

Historian Jeffrey Richardson Brackett writing in his 1890 study, _Notes on the Progress of the Colored People of Maryland Since the War_ observed:

> It has been said that in no city are there so many colored house-holders as in Baltimore. Many of the wealthy colored men have invested largely in houses in a few cases, a whole row is owned by one man. The extent of the town, the number of alleys, and the great number of small houses, of two stories only, facilitate this for one must not suppose that the seventy-five houses said to be owned by one colored citizen of Annapolis, for instance, are all expensive buildings or on valuable ground.

Brackett highlighted the importance of black-organized housing associations continuing:

> Another series of associations, organized in East Baltimore in 1868, had about a hundred members and probably facilitated the purchase of forty or fifty houses. In both cases the members have been mostly poor men. These associations are well spoken of, and have no doubt done good ; but little has been done in this way by the colored people in proportion to the work among the German residents of Baltimore […] It is said that it was not easy for colored men, until recently, to secure houses in reasonably good localities. A recent mayor of Baltimore has stated and the statement appeared in print that in his experience the colored people have proved themselves good tenants.

## 1893: Racial covenants

Roland Park …

## 1898: Ministerial Union calls for investigation into colored housing

On April 11, 1898, the _Sun_ reported under the headline “HOMES OF COLORED PERSONS: The Ministerial Union To Have An Investigation Made In The Interest Of Public Health”:

> At the next meeting of the Ministerial Union, the first Thursday in May, committees will be appointed to visit various sections of the city where colored persons reside, principally and report as to the condition of the dwellings and the sanitary arrangements thereof, with a view of furnishing data for public meetings to be held...

## 1904: White residents in Locust Point reportedly attack black households

On October 8, 1910, as the city wrestled  the Baltimore Sun published an article under the loud headline, "THEY BLOCKED INVASION / Residents Of Locust Point Quickly Solved Negro Problem. BY FORCE AND MORAL SUASION / Young Men Of Southeast Baltimore Always Ready To Protect The Female Sex From Discourtesies," continuing:

> As time passed negroes moved into Sharp street, in Southwest Baltimore, and some began to work in developing Locust Point water front. Some families evidenced a desire to live near their work. They were told by some of the Locust Point white men that if they moved into that section they would also die near their work. The white men meant it, the negroes realized it, and it is doubtful if there is a negro family in all Locust Point.
> On evening about six years ago a negro family moved into a house in Locust Point. The furniture arrived at 6 o'clock. At midnight the house was a total wreck. The doors had been torn from their hinges and the window frames smashed. At 7 o'clock the next morning the negroes had left. They never came back.

This Locust Point example illustrates the violence frequently used to enforce the boundaries of racially segregated housing.

# 1905-1929

## 1906: White neighbors resist the sale of a 604 North Gilmor Street to African Americans

Attempts by African Americans to purchase homes in segregated white neighborhoods continued to attract attention, as the _Baltimore Sun_ reported on an example from North Gilmore Street in 1906:

> An indignation meeting was held last night at the home of Dr. G. W. Norris, 620 North Gllmor street, to take action against the occupation of 604 North Gilmor street by a negro orphan asylum, and there were some remarks of a heated nature.
 
## 1906: Colonel Clotworthy advocates for clearance of “undesirable homes”

In 1906, Colonel C. Baker Clotworthy, commander of the Fifth Regiment, wrote to the _Sun_ advocating for the extension of Howard Street north of the Richmond Market as a way of demolishing black households:

> I would be deeply interested in this improvement because it means so much more than simply tearing down some houses and opening a street. Everyone in the city is familiar with the steady decrease which has taken place in the value of property in this neighborhood for the last 20 years.
> All about Richmond Market, and extending north, there are hundreds of undesirable houses and, in many cases, huts. This sore is spreading rapidly. A great many negroes, not of the best class,  gradually tenant the houses on the edge of this district and immediately the white people move from the block invaded. If this continues no one knows where it will stop.

## 1907: Janet Kemp study on housing conditions in Baltimore

Emily Lieb in _“We Clean-Up, Paint-Up, and Fix-Up Our Neighborhoods”_ writes:

> In 1906, the sanitarian Janet Kemp began a yearlong investigation of conditions in four of Baltimore’s poorest neighborhoods: two “tenement districts” that housed mostly Eastern European immigrants and two “alley districts” that housed mostly African-Americans. (According to the City Charter, a tenement was a building that housed more than three families. An alley house was a narrow rowhouse located in an alley or “minor street” sometimes less than 10 feet wide. Though these latter houses were often extremely crowded, they could not usually hold more than one or two families and so did not qualify as “tenements.”) In all, Kemp inspected nearly 600 houses occupied by around 1,200 families. Just as Frances Morton would do a generation later, she published her findings in 1907 in a photo-illustrated book called Housing Conditions in Baltimore. As historian Samuel K. Roberts has noted, Kemp’s point of view was as moralizing and frankly eugenic as any almost other white Progressive’s. (Of the African-Americans she met in the alley districts, she wrote: “It is impossible to observe these gregarious, light-hearted, shiftless, irresponsible alley dwellers without wondering to what extent their failings are the result of their surroundings, and to what extent the inhabitants, in turn, react for evil upon their environment.”) However, as she pointed out, hers was a study of housing conditions and not “social conditions,” so the remedy she prescribed was less incumbent on neighborhood residents than on city officials: she recommended that Baltimore write a housing code and enforce it.

## 1910: West Segregation Ordinance

On September 9, 1910, the _Sun_ reported on “NEGRO HOMES STONED: Windows And Vestibules Damaged On McCulloh Street WHITE RESIDENTS WORRIED Third Family Of Negroes Now Moving Into No. 1804 Causes Neighbors To Fear For Their Property” —

> ”I expect to live here permanently," yesterday declared William B. Hamer, the negro who created a stir among his white neighbors on Wednesday when he moved into the house at 1802 McCulloh street.

The relationship between racial transition and racial segregation is clear beginning in 1910 when Baltimore became the first city in the United States to enact a law requiring racial segregation. In response to the attempt by George W. F. McMechen to move onto the 1800 block of McCulloh Street in 1910, Baltimore established a formal segregation ordinance which forbid black residents from moving to designated “white blocks” and white residents from moving to designated “colored blocks.”

On December 20, 1910, Baltimore Mayor John Barry Mahool signed into law the West Segregation Ordinance, named for sponsor Council Samuel L. West, which identified each block in the city according to the racial identity of the majority of each block’s residents in 1910. While the West Segregation Ordinance was soon overturned as unconstitutional, its passage and the multiple subsequent attempts to enact a municipal law to enforce racial segregation reflected the deep resistance of white Baltimore residents to racial integration. As a consequence, the area of Old West Baltimore, including the neighborhoods of Harlem Park, Sandtown-Winchester, and Upton, became a predominantly African American community and together with a segregated area in East Baltimore some of the only areas open to African American residents.

## 1917: Mayor Preston creates new committee on housing conditions for African Americans

On February 27, 1917, Mayor Preston organized a committee as the _Sun_ reported under the headline – TO PLAN NEGRO HOUSING: Mayor Names Committee To Consider Baltimore's Problem Of Health Conditions –

> Mayor Preston took another step yesterday in the movement to provide better housing and living conditions for the 90,000 negroes in Baltimore by appointing the committee authorized at the City Hall conference last Friday to study the problem and recommend a plan looking to its solution. He named...

On March 26, 1917, the _Sun_ reported:

> NEW CITY LOAN INDORSED: Improvements Declared To Mean Much For Baltimore's Future DR. WELCH SEES BIG BENEFITS Says Solution Of Negro Housing Problem Alone Would Be Inestimable Public Service / A solution of the problem of better housing for Baltimore's 90,000 negroes will be offered to the voters of Baltimore in November when they will to asked to approve a bond issue of $3,000.000 which will serve a four-fold purpose without cost to the taxpayers.

On June 18, 1919, the _Sun_ reported that little had been done, writing:

> PARK BOARD IS WILLING: Ready To Provide Breathing Place In Congested Negro Area CANNOT GO AHEAD, HOWEVER And Project Apparently Is Halted Unless Mayor Recognizes Preston Commission Of 1917 / All that the Park Board is waiting -for the to create a big breathing space in Congested negro districts of Baltimore is for somebody to take; the initiative. …”

## 1924: Racial covenants in West Baltimore

In January 1924, representatives from the Tolson Spring Association joined with the Fulton Avenue Protective Association, Madison Avenue Improvement Association, Lafayette Square Protective Association, the Harlem Park Association, and Garrett Park Association in a meeting at the Fulton Avenue Presbyterian Church. With 200 people in attendance, their purpose was to resist the movement of African American households into these western neighborhoods. Dr. C.P. Woodward, the City Councilman for the 5th district, remarked:

> The principal function of any organization is to acquire everything of benefit to the community and to keep away everything undesirable. It is a pity that law-abiding citizens who do not receive sufficient protection from the law to keep out undesirables must form protective associations to do so.

The January 1924 meeting was also covered by the *Baltimore Afro-American*, which summarized the sentiment of the speakers as, "Negroes should be put in a bag and pitched overboard." The result was a campaign to get 1600 property owners in an area bounded by North Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue and Bentalou Street to sign commitments not to sell to African Americans. This coalition was formally constituted a week later adding the Woodbrook Association, Druid Park Association, Northwest Baltimore Association, and the Citizens' Association (Govans) to its membership under the leadership of Robert L. Reamy, President of the Lafayette Square Association.

These efforts to promote segregation were challenged by other civic associations and reform-minded individuals. One such group was the Inter-Racial Conference, which included leaders from St. Michael and All Angels' Protestant Episcopal Church, the Prisoners' Aid Association of Maryland, Professor Mason Hawkins who was a teacher at the Colored High School, and others. Professor Broadus Mitchell from Johns Hopkins University reflected:  

> Many negroes are seeking better quarters in which to live. Many white persons are doing the same thing. As to where these boundaries will stop it is difficult to say. One thing is certain, however, and that is we hinder our best progress by stirring up strife between the races.

Around the same period, in the area of Mount Royal Avenue, a group of 300 northwest Baltimore residents (led by the president of the Baltimore Bar Library and the neighborhood's City Council representative, among others) responded to the movement of African American households onto Bolton Street by signing racial covenants barring the sale or lease of their properties to African Americans. In one account from the 1920s, the Mount Royal Protective Association boasted of their efforts to secure and enforce racial covenants from local property owners describing their "greatest achievement” as “the subjecting of the property in its area to a restriction for white occupancy only.”

## 1927: Mayor Howard Jackson signs new housing code into law

Emily Lieb in _“We Clean-Up, Paint-Up, and Fix-Up Our Neighborhoods”_ writes:

> Thus, in 1927, Democratic Mayor Howard Jackson signed a new housing code, one that relieved building owners and developers of most of the burdens the 1908 law had imposed. The new law declared simply that any condition “detrimental to life or health” should be “removed, abated, suspended, or otherwise improved”—a use of the passive voice that suggested that the job would fall to no one in particular. The city no longer employed any full-time housing inspectors. The Health Department had no power to issue prohibitive fines or take people to court.

# 1929 – 1954

## 1934: Influential canvass of Baltimore housing identified a “ring of blight”

First planned public housing project, Poe Homes – 298 3-story garden apartments:

> “A coalition of homeowners denied that their neighborhood was a slum and demanded that their houses be ‘reconditioned and not destroyed.’

> “One Housing Authority manager recognized that the McCulloh Homes project planned for West Baltimore would create ‘a splendid barrier against the encroachment of coloreds’ into the adjoining white neighborhood of Bolton Hill.”

On June 3, 1935, the _Sun_ reported:

> FHA "WORTHLESS," SAYS RABBI ISRAEL: He Holds It Valueless In So Far As Providing Housing For The Very Poor SLUM HOMES DEPLORED Hundreds Of Children Murdered In City Because Of Conditions, Is Claim In Speech / Public housing for "those who need it most," rather than for "those best able to pay for it," was advocated by Rabbi Edward L. Israel, last night in an address during which he described tho Federal Housing Administration—for any social purposes — as. "absolutely worthless."

## 1937: Frances H. Morton publishes study on black housing conditions in East Baltimore

Emily Lieb in _“We Clean-Up, Paint-Up, and Fix-Up Our Neighborhoods”_ writes:

> Morton spent a year studying the blocks around Reid House, and in 1937 she published the 86-page A Social Study of Wards 5 and 10 in Baltimore, Maryland. Her report described a part of the city in which, she wrote, “the housing situation is very bad.” Most of the people Morton met there did not have electricity or central heating. Though there was a city ordinance requiring property owners to install toilets and connect them to the municipal sewer system, the rule was barely enforced, and most of the plumbing Morton found was “of the lowest standard allowable under the law and continually in need of repair.” Fire hydrants were often the most reliable sources of running water. Except for the whites-only facilities in churches and other public buildings, most of the neighborhood’s toilets were located in backyard outhouses known as yard hoppers. In general, Morton calculated that more than 90% of the structures she saw were “in need of repairs of some sort.” Worse, more than 2,500 of the neighborhood’s 4,000 buildings were “uninhabitable”; and worst of all, most of those uninhabitable buildings were fully inhabited. In her report, Morton made two major proposals, both of which brought the weight of government to bear on the problem of bad housing. First, she urged slum clearance and redevelopment. “Low cost housing,” she wrote, “must be made available to Negroes that will insure them sufficient light and air, proper heating facilities and decent plumbing.” Second, she pushed for an official “campaign for cleanliness of dwellings, yards, and alleys,” a city-sponsored rehabilitation drive that would ensure livable conditions in even the oldest and poorest neighborhoods.

# 1941 – 1954

During the 1910s and 1920s, racial transition in West Baltimore neighborhoods was occasionally accompanied by violence against black residents and white residents who rented or sold properties to black Baltimoreans. Around the beginning of WWII, the “color line” had stabilized around Fulton Avenue. Beginning in the late 1940s, however, neighborhoods at this edge began to transition from white to black. The change was driven by a number of factors including the rapid growth of Baltimore’s African American population during the 1940s and 1950s, the intense overcrowding and deteriorating housing conditions within historically segregated African American neighborhoods, and the movement of white households out of the center city to the areas of new development in the Baltimore suburbs.

## 1941: Baltimore approves new Ordinance on the Hygiene of Housing to address overcrowding, “slums”

On October 3, 1941, the _Sun_ reported:

> NEGRO HOUSING HELD HEALTH MENACE HERE: Colored Doctor Tells Plan Body Of Race Overcrowding Warns Contagious Disease May Spread As Result  / Large areas of the city populated by Negroes are overcrowded to the point where it is almost impossible to secure living quarters of even the most primitive type and there is grave danger that this condition may result in a spread of contagious disease, it was asserted yesterday at the City Hall.

In one indication of the worsening conditions that led to quickening racial transitions, from January 1941 to November 1941 alone, housing vacancies for units open to African American occupancy shrank from .8% to .1%.

According to Emily Lieb in _“We Clean-Up, Paint-Up, and Fix-Up Our Neighborhoods”: The Baltimore Plan and the Broken Promise of Housing Rehabilitation in the Postwar American City_, 1941 was a watershed year:

> In 1941, Baltimore outlawed its slums. “Every dwelling and every part thereof shall be kept clean and free from any accumulation of dirt, filth, rubbish, garbage or similar matter,” declared that year’s new Ordinance on the Hygiene of Housing, and “shall be maintained in good repair by the owner or agent, and fit for human habitation.” More to the point, the law authorized the Commissioner of Health to “issue orders compelling the compliance with said provisions, or to correct the condition, at the expense of the property owner.” What followed was a 15-year–long code-enforcement and housing-rehabilitation campaign known as the Baltimore Plan, whose premise was simple: as one of its architects put it, “the principal cause of slums is neglect, and the answer to neglect is vigilance, and the place to start being vigilant is city government.”

## 1943: Republican Mayor Theodore McKeldin elected with campaign promise to break “deadlock” on “Negro housing”

According to Emily Lieb in _“We Clean-Up, Paint-Up, and Fix-Up Our Neighborhoods”: The Baltimore Plan and the Broken Promise of Housing Rehabilitation in the Postwar American City_, 1941 was a watershed year:

> A big part of McKeldin’s appeal was his stance on Baltimore’s substandard-housing problem: that is, he seemed genuinely to want to solve it. He favored building new housing for low-income people, and he had campaigned on a promise to “[break] the deadlock between city officials in the matter of Negro housing.” More immediately, though, McKeldin was determined to carry out the Baltimore Plan in word and deed. “What I have seen appalls me,” he told a Sun reporter after accompanying Health Commissioner Williams on a tour of Baltimore’s slums. “We have got to have unanimity of action if we are to correct these conditions. Therefore, I want to…lend support to blotting out the flagrant violations and forcing landlords to bring substandard buildings up to safe and sound condition at the very least.”

On May 5, 1944 the _Sun_ reported:

> Slow Progress In Negro Housing / The real meat in the report of Housing Authority of Baltimore on rent lists can be found in the data Negro housing. Not one of the dwelling units assigned for Negro is vacant. Jn contrast, there are vacancies in the white and these vacancies cover an...

In a letter to Mayor McKeldin in July 1945, in response to the efforts by a group of 350 residents in the Fulton Avenue area to prevent black residents from moving west, the NAACP argued "growth demands that we take in those streets that fringe our area since every attempt to enter new sections is vigorously denied." The Citizens Committee for Justice and the Baltimore Urban League observed "the need for more housing is most sharply felt in the Negro community, where there are virtually no vacancies of any type."

In _Wages of War: The Shifting Landscape of Race and Gender in World War II Baltimore_, Amy Betnley describes the housing conditions for African-Americans living in Baltimore during WWII:

> Although by 1940 available housing for white families was about average for cities the size of Baltimore, there was practically no city housing for African Americans. Strict segregation limited blacks mainly to three small areas in the oldest and most dilapidated sections of town, although the newcomers swelling the ranks forced some enlargement of the boundaries. The area totaled only about three square miles, resulting in population density of as high as 78,000 persons per square mile. Because of the cramped spaces, lack of employment, and discrimination in general, most of Baltimore's black population experienced dismal living conditions. In 1945 the director of the sanitary section of the Baltimore City Health Department noted that living conditions like those described as follows "were not unusual in Baltimore.”
> “Families were crowded into any available space from cellar to attic in dwellings which had already reached a state of dilapidation, were woefully lacking in sanitary facilities, and infested with rats and vermin. Many houses formerly occupied by one, two or three families were divided and subdivided again and again to become the homes for six, eight or ten families. It was not unusual to find one bathroom being used by twenty-five or thirty persons ... no provisions made for the disposal of garbage or rubbish that was found in piles in cellars, yards or hallways; plumbing in such a state of disrepair as to be unusable; hazardous types of cooking and heating installations present- ing possibilities of carbon monoxide poisoning; structural defects and lack of adequate exits presenting accident and fire hazards; and an abundance of bedbugs, roaches, and rats.”
> The director went on to tell about a landlord who would not clean up the dwellings  he rented to Baltimore blacks "because in his opinion the Negro occupants did not deserve better housing. [The landlord] frankly said so and continued to take his rent from them.”[^3]

## 1943: Baltimore Sun reports on “Negro Archipelegos”

An October 1948 editorial in the *Baltimore Sun* described the “colored section of most cities” as “already dangerously overcrowded” and noted that only 2% of new housing built in 1948 was open to African Americans, despite representing 20% of Baltimore’s total population. By 1950, Baltimore had 226,053 black residents, representing 23.8% of the population but occupying only 19.4% of dwelling units. This pattern continued into the early 1950s: of the 53,000 permits issued new homes in Baltimore metropolitan area from 1950 to 1953, only 3,200 of those were open to African American households, even as the black population increased another 10%.

On May 5, 1944, the Sun reported on “Slow Progress In Negro Housing,” writing:

> The real meat in the report of Housing Authority of Baltimore on rent lists can be found in the data Negro housing. Not one of the dwelling units assigned for Negro is vacant. Jn contrast, there are vacancies in the white and these vacancies cover an...

## 1945: White neighbors attack black household at 816 N. Fulton Avenue

When African American residents began responding to this housing crisis by purchasing homes in formerly segregated white neighborhoods some white resident met them with violence. In 1945, a group of people, described by the Baltimore Afro American as "hoodlums who resented having the Millers move into a white neighborhood," threw bricks at the home of James Miller and his family at 816 N. Fulton Avenue, breaking glass in the front door and windows.

The _Baltimore Sun_ expanded on this account writing:

> “Of at least fifty houses on Fulton Avenue now owned by colored persons between the 500 and 1800 blocks, only one case of violence has been reported by one of the three families now known to occupy homes there. The James Miller family, which moved into 816 N. Fulton Avenue on February 15, reported that bricks were thrown through a window and door panel on the following Saturday. The second floor of this house is occupied by the William Montgomery family… Among Fulton Avenue property owners are the Rev. Hiram J. Smith, Dr. Bruce Alleyne and the Medicos Club, an organization of physicians and dentists. "For Sale" signs may be seen all along Fulton Avenue.”

In August 1948, a house on the 1300 block of Payson Street just to the north of the district was subject to an arson attempt, attributed to retaliation against a white Jewish home-owner who had “broken” the block by selling a property to an African American homeowner in 1946.

In July 1950 after Ms. Beatrice Sessoms, a native of North Carolina who came to Baltimore in 1948, moved with her nephew to the 2300 block of Lauretta Avenue, her house was attacked.

Dr. Ed Orser quotes one black resident of Greater Rosemont recalling the history of white flight in the late 1940s:

> Black people started moving out of the confined areas somewhere around 1947 or 1948, but what would happen was that whites would evacuate a block or two blocks, and black people would move in. The evacuation would take place first. I remember streets like Fulton Avenue, Monroe Street—they were once totally white, and they went through the transition and changed somewhere between 1946 and 1949—that was the time I was in service. When I went in, there were no black people when I came out, there they were black streets… But it wasn’t integration… it was an evacuation.

These initial movements soon accelerated, particularly in west and northwest areas of Baltimore. Lula Jones Garrett, a columnist for the _Baltimore Afro_, observed in a column titled “Change-the-Address New Game on Baltimore Front” writing:

> “What with the local yokels forsaking the ghettos and moving into swankier mansions, it takes a special edition of the directory to locate your best friends these days.”

Among the new home-owners recently arrived on Bentalou Street were Everett Lane, attorney and Mrs. Lane who moved from Division Street, teacher Theresa Thompson, ARC executive Anne Fulwood, and Bettye Murphy and Frank Phillipses at 2047 Bentalou Street.

The process of this rapid transition is closely associated with negative accounts of realtors or "block-busters" using a range of tactics to take advantage of both white sellers and black buyers. For example, during the 1940s and 1950s many African American households purchased home under land-installment contracts or buy-like-rent arrangements, also known as lease option contracts, that allowed home-owners to purchase property without an initial down payment or closing charges. However, these arrangements did not immediately transfer title to the property and the contract could still be terminated if the new home-owner missed a single payment. Although the black home-ownership rate rose by 194% between 1940 and 1950, in comparison to 58.8% for whites, a 1955 survey by the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations found that 53% of their respondents had purchased their homes through such arrangements rather than regular financing.

One example is found in the account offered by Tom Cripps to Antero Pietella, of the attempts to induce panic selling in white sellers. In 1947, Cripps witnessed a man with suit  in the area around his home at 2323 Mosher Street carrying signs "This House is Not for Sale," with the implication that the neighborhood was imminently threatened with transition. In fact, his family was the first household on the block to sell their property to a black family when they sold the property to Ellsworth F. Davage, a Baltimore County school teacher, and his wife Elizabeth in 1949.

## 1952: Morgan State University study finds racially skewed affect with urban renewal in Waverly

According to [https://indyreader.org/content/history-housing-policy-and-segregation-baltimore](https://indyreader.org/content/history-housing-policy-and-segregation-baltimore)
> According to a 1952 study by Morgan State University, the project displaced what was formally a racially mixed community with 61% African-American and 39% Caucasian, with many of the African American residents moving to segregated projects in the city.  The East Baltimore component of the City’s 1950’s redevelopment project expanded Johns Hopkins Hospital into the block bounded by Broadway, McElderry, Monument, and Caroline with housing for Hopkins students.

## 1953: Dr. Robert L. Jackson, W.A.C. Hughes protest clearance of Armory site for State Center

In 1953, plans for the redevelopment of the “Armory site” came before the City Planning Commission. Dr. Robert L. Jackson, only black member of the City Planning Commission, opposed the proposal for the area arguing, ”950 colored families must move out of the area, and he [Jackson] could not ascertain how many can come back." In response, Richard L. Steiner, director of the local redevelopment program said that he, "figured there will be room for about 370 families in the new apartments to be built in the area adjoining the State office site but couldn't state how many would be colored." The _Sun_ quotes Steiner suggesting that the city could not be obligated to replace the housing lost in the process, noting  ”That's in the hands of the redeveloper.”

The Armory site had been selected not with support from the district’s residents but instead with support from the nearby Mt. Royal Improvement Association, which in 1953, rallied over 200 people to support the selection of the site as an urban renewal area calling it "best means of salvaging a run down area."

NAACP, represented by W.A.C. Hughes opposed the development, Hughes office located there and his mother owned property in the area. Hughes volunteered with the NAACP as a lawyer from the 1930s through his death in 1966, Morgan State stadium named after him”

## 1955: African American residents move west of the Gwynns Falls

The issue reached Edmondson Village around 1955, when the first black residents moved west of the Gwynns Falls to live in the southeast corner of the region, around the western end of the Baltimore Street Bridge. One white resident remarked on the experience, commenting to Dr. Ed Orser:

> “When the [black] people started moving into the neighborhood, they did come in, literally block by block. I can recall when they came across the… bridge, everybody was very upset; they said, ‘Oh my God, they’re over the bridge now; our street will be next.’”

In April 1958, the improvement group organized their annual meeting at School No. 88 located at Wildwood Parkway and Gelston Drive, hosting Chief Judge Delany Foster of the Orphans Court of Baltimore as the guest speaker. In July 1958, Association president L.E. Larsen gave the association’s support to a plan sponsored by the Baltimore Urban League, the Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations, and the Citizens Planning and Housing Association to “combat the conversion of Baltimore areas from all-white to all-Negro occupancy.” Larsen observed that Edmondson Village:

> “already faced with pressure from block-busting realtor tactics and population shifts… the exodus from the city of the stable core of responsible citizens will likely be accelerated and the inevitable consequences will be a set-back to many of the long-range plans now being developed and implemented.”

An African American resident in this period later shared her experience in an oral history with Dr. Ed Orser, remarking:

> “When we first moved to the neighborhood, it was more white – we were just about the second black family on this block... We could see the changes, because when we moved, there were so many sale signs all around, and it did make a difference in the neighborhood, because there was a change, and you had to get yourself adjusted to the people who were moving in, and you couldn’t really know the ones who were moving out, because they were leaving so fast, so we were really going through a transitional stage. People were moving in and out overnight; you didn’t really know who your neighbors were. It was a difficult period, because when we moved, we thought maybe the neighborhood would be stabilized; it just wasn’t.”

According to [Indyreader](https://indyreader.org/content/history-housing-policy-and-segregation-baltimore)

> In the period between 1950 and 1964, Baltimore embarked on an aggressive urban renewal program that displaced more than 25,000 people, 85% of them African-American.  In 1953, the City’s Redevelopment Commission designated eight areas of the city to be redeveloped, including urban renewal projects in Waverly and the area just west of Johns Hopkins Hospital.  In Waverly, a residential and commercial project that included 290 apartments and 270 parking spaces was designated by the Redevelopment Commission for white occupants only. 

On May 26, 1957, the _Baltimore Sun_ reported, HOUSING SEEN RACE HURDLE: N.A.A.C.P. Official Assails Rent, Purchase Setup:

> Negro and white families alike suffer from existing practices of segregation in housing. Clarence Mitchell, director of the Washington branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said here last night.

## 1959: Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. founded by James Rouse, Ellsworth Rosen, and Sidney Hollander, Jr.

According to a [short history of Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc.](http://www.bni-maryland.org/Documents/History.pdf) in 1959:

> In the 1950's a group of enlightened Baltimore homeowners sought to enlist like-minded civic and neighborhood organizations and the business community to encourage stable, integrated neighborhood housing "white flight" from the City. Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. (BNI), incorporated in March of 1959 by James Rouse, Ellsworth Rosen, and Sidney Hollander, Jr.

By 1960, however, the area south of Edmondson Village had changed from more than 99% white in 1950 to 62% black in 1960 and, a decade later, 92% black in 1970. Edmondson Village itself remained 99% white in 1960 but had changed to 97% black by 1970.

Although little evidence documents widespread physical violence on a scale comparable to white antagonists in Detroit or Chicago, the State Commission on Interracial Problems observed in 1958, "The problem it said, is not with violence 'but with the frigid withdrawal' of whites from the Negroes." During the late 1950s, the State Commission and others finally engaged with the ongoing process of racial transition with the beginning of advocacy and organizing efforts to promote “neighborhood stabilization.”

On Feb 27, 1961, the _Baltimore Sun _ reported under the headline “Minor Difference?: Race And Renewal,” writing:

> After leaders of the city's renewal agency and the Baltimore branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People faced each other for two hours across the Mayor's office recently, Mayor Grady summed up their dispute as "a minor difference of words."

## 1966: George P. Mahoney runs for Governor in campaign opposing open housing

As Richard Hardesty, in “‘A Veil of Voodoo’: George P. Mahoney, Open Housing, and the 1966 Governor's Race,” observed:

> The 1966 governor's race represented Mahoney's most notorious campaign. His stand against open housing defined the election and offers an opportunity for a deeper look into this legendary figure. Although Spiro T. Agnew won the 1966 governor's race, Mahoney represented the campaign's central figure. He based his entire campaign on his opposition to open housing. Espoused in the slogan, "Your Home is Your Castle—Protect It," Mahoney capitalized on the growing white backlash to narrowly win the Democratic nomination in September 1966. At a time when crime, tax reform, and a new constitution represented Maryland's most pressing issues, Mahoney focused the public's attention on open housing, turning the national issue of civil rights into the primary focus of a statewide campaign.

During the Democratic Party primary, a “white backlash” against open housing led enough voters to Mahoney for him to win the primary, including Baltimore where a split endorsement between Senator Verda Welcome and Clarence Mitchell diminished the power of African-American voters, as Hardesty noted:

> Nonetheless, Mahoney still managed to carry Baltimore City by 2,236 votes. The white back- lash played a key role in the victory. By opposing open housing, Mahoney gained the support of a considerable portion of the city's white working-class population. These working-class whites supported Mahoney, even though the Maryland AFL- CIO and the United Auto Workers (U.A.W.) endorsed Sickles. For example, in East Baltimore's Ward I, Mahoney received sixty-eight percent of the vote.Mahoney's success led Albert Mattes of the U.A.W to declare that "members of organized labor have deserted their union in the field of political action."

Despite Mahoney’s success in the primary, he lost to Spiro Agnew in the general election with key support from African-American voters in Baltimore, as Richard Hardesty noted:

> Most of all, Agnew secured victory by capturing Baltimore City through a coalition that included middle- and-upper-class voters, Jewish voters, and African American voters. Baltimore City had the highest voter registration totals in Mary- land. In all, the city had 411,055 registered voters, of which 337,558 were registered Democrats. Agnew carried the city with 114,262 votes, and, while he did not win a majority, he defeated Mahoney by a comfortable margin. For his part, Mahoney ran strongly with white working class voters. Kenneth D. Durr noted that "the same working-class whites who had voted by a 64 percent margin for George Wallace gave Mahoney 71 percent of the vote." […] Divided during the Democratic primary, prominent African American leaders such as Clarence Mitchell III and Verda Welcome expressed little concern about bolting the Democratic Party. Furthermore, the predominantly African American Fourth District threw its support behind Agnew. African Americans helped Agnew win Baltimore City as well as the governorship.”

## 1969: The Activists organize to fight housing discrimination

In 1969, a coalition of black and white civil rights advocates, including chairman Sampson Green, an African-American attorney, member of the Maryland Human Relations Commission, and housing committee chairman, and John J. Martinez, white Jesuit teacher at St. Bernadine’s, organized The Activists—an interracial fair housing organization. The group targeted the Morris Goldseker Company with protests outside its downtown offices highlighting its role as “block-busters.” Operating under a variety of names, the Goldseker-related realty companies doubled the mark-up on house sales in Edmondson Village in comparison to other areas. The Activists described how companies purchased houses for an average of $7,320 and sold them for an average of $12,387, a markup of 69%, with the inescapable conclusion that, “The dollar in the hands of the white man buys more than the dollar in the hands of the black man.”

## 1982: Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman

According to a [short history of Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc.](http://www.bni-maryland.org/Documents/History.pdf) in 1982:

> BNI's first efforts at testing for housing discrimination were hampered until 1982, when a case known as Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman gave legal standing to fair housing organizations and testers. BNI also devoted itself to the education of both black and white communities about open housing and to building bridges of cooperation with the real estate industry and government agencies. Over the years, it has handled many thousands of housing discrimination complaints, many of which were successfully resolved through negotiation and some of which have been referred to federal, state and local organizations for resolution. In recent years justice in housing has come to include fair treatment for other groups, most notably persons with disabilities and families with children. Since 1979, BNI has counseled tenants and landlords, expanding statewide in 1991 thanks to a grant from Maryland Legal Services Corporation.
