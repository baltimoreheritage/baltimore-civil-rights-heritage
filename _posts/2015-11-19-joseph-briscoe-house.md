# History of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue

Built sometime in the mid late 19th century, by 1887, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue was the residence of George W. King, a prominent local printer. King evidently engaged in speculative development within the neighborhood, as he rented and repeatedly tried to sell a property at 2118 Druid Hill Avenue.  The _Baltimore Sun_  published a classified advertisement on Feb 4, 1887:

> 2118 Druid Hill Avenue, 10 rooms, large parlor, dry cellar, nice yard. Apply 1232 DRUID HILL AVENUE.

By May 16, 1891, King started advertising the property at 2118 Druid Hill Avenue for sale, noted in a classified advertisement:

> FOR SALE—In fee or with ground rent, 2118 DRUID HILL AVENUE. 16x90, cable road passes door; rents for $25. Apply at 1232 DRUID HILL AVENUE.

The sale appears to have been unsuccessful as King continued to advertise the property for rent on October 8, 1896:

> FOR RENT—2118 DRUID HILL AVENUE, 10 rooms and bath. Apply as above or 1232 DRUID HILL AVENUE.

In addition to his work as a printer and small scale investor, King also volunteered as an election judge for the 3rd, 4th and 7th precincts (according to a list appearing in the  _Baltimore Sun_ on September 19, 1889).

George W. King died in November 1898, with an obituary appearing in the _Baltimore Sun_ on November 14, 1898:

> Mr. George W. King, founder of the firm of King Brothers, printers, died early Saturday morning at his home, 1232 Druid Hill avenue. Mr. King was one of the oldest active printers in the city. He was born seventy-two years ago, and at the age of seventeen years he began his apprenticeship. Upon reaching his majority he founded the firm of King Brothers. For a number of years the firm had exclusive charge of the printing for the city, and many official books came from their press.

King’s death in 1898 coincided with the broader transition of district (now known as Upton or Marble Hill) population from largely white, European American households to become largely African American. On January 10, 1903, the _Afro-American_ published an account of “A New Year's Eve Reception” at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue, then the residence of Joseph Briscoe:

> Messrs Joseph Briscoe and Columbus Ramsey entertained many of their friends at dinner, Wednesday evening, December 31st, at the former's residence 1232 Druid Hill Ave. The dining and drawing rooms were artistically decorated with holly, evergreen and smilax, while large potted plants completed the decoration. The Menu which was nicely prepared but more nicely consumed, consisted of oysters on the shell, bouillon, turkey stuffed with chestnuts, Smithfield ham, hominy on chafing, individual ices and beverages to the course. At the stroke of twelve the guest knelt down in silent prayer which was lead by Mr. Abram Briscoe.

Joseph C. Briscoe was the long-time principal of the Colored Vocational School (designated school no. 454( located at Carrollton and Lafayette Avenues. Briscoe later lived at 1713 N. Calhoun Street but Briscoe and his family appear to be one of the first African American households to move to 1232 Druid Hill Avenue.

By October 4, 1908, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue was up for sale, advertised under “Real Estate for Sale” in the _Baltimore Sun_: 

> ONLY $1,000.00 FOR 816 N. BOND ST., $2,500 for 1232 DRUID HILL AVE., $1,350 for 559 LAURENS ST.; Houses, small and large, in every section of the city for sale on very easy terms. C. MORTON, 209 St. Paul street.

Evidently, the sale was unsuccessful as George W. King (a son [?] of the original George King) retained ownership through at least 1912. On May 20, 1912, a second advertisement for the property appeared in the _Sun_:

> FOR SALE—DWELLING 1232 DRUID HILL AVE. Apply GEORGE W. KING / 31 South Howard street.

On August 9, 1912, the property was advertised for sale in the _Afro-American_:

> In Fee—400 E. 25th, 1213 W. Lexington near Franklin Square; also 1232 Druid Hill ave., 609 N. Calhoun, opposite Harlem Square. CHARLES MORTON, 209 St. Paul St.

It was around 1903 that the property appears to have been converted from a residence for a single households into apartments for multiple households. The new residents of the property are working-class African Americans evidenced by the advertisements that appeared in the _Baltimore Sun_ under “Situation Wanted—Female.” For example, on March 27, 1909, a resident listed an advertisement seeking work:

> LAUNDRESS WANTS LAUNDRY WORK; finery specialty; housecleaning by day; can give references. 1232 DRUID HILL AVE.

On January 29, 1923, another resident sought work with an advertisement under “Situations—Male,” stating:

> CHAUFFEUR, first-class, wishes position with private family; 3 years' reference from last employer. 1232 Druid Hill ave.

On September 1, 1923, a young women advertised under “Under Situations—Female,” noting:

> GIRL (colored), place Cook or Chambermaid; stay nights. 1232 DRUID HILL AVE.

On September 11, 1923, another resident advertised under “Situations—Female,” noting:

> A VERY intelligent colored High School Girl wishes job in private family of the school. Apply 1232 DRUID HILL AVE. First Floor.

On October 25, 1939, another resident advertised under “Situations—Female,” noting:

> YOUNG WOMAN (colored) desires day's work. $1.50 and carfare. 1232 Druid Hill ave. 3rd floor.

African Americans in Baltimore, broadly excluded from employment opportunities in Baltimore’s growing industrial sector, faced particular challenges around poverty. In addition, the violence common in all of Baltimore’s working class communities could also be found in the neighborhood of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue. For example, on September 12, 1909, the _Baltimore Sun_ reported under the headline “Three Shot in "Fuss" Over Woman,” writing:

> As the result of a pistol affray, Charles Coates, 429 Tyson street; Margaret Coates and Charles Clemens, 1232 Druid Hill avenue, colored were all slightly wounded yesterday morning at the house, 1232 Druid Hill avenue, and the two men were committed by Justice Tyson, at the Northwestern Police Station, on the charge of assaulting and shooting each other. The shooting occurred at about 9.15 o'clock in the morning and was concerning the woman. Clemens was shot in the left arm, Margaret Coates in the hand and 
> Charles Coates in the hip.

Encounters between the Baltimore police and African Americans in Baltimore were often fraught, as in the example of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue resident Henry Larkins, noted as a chauffeur who appears in a report published in the _Afro-American_ on February 28, 1925:

> Thirteen men were taken in a raid on a game in the rear of 2025 Madison avenue, Saturday. The game  was in progress in a garage on the second floor of which is a chauffeur's club is conducted. […] Those who were fined $1 and costs were: […] Henry Larkins, 1232 Druid Hill avenue […]

In addition to crime reports, the _Afro-American_ also chronicled the lives and events of the neighborhood more broadly. On February 26, 1910, the _Afro-American_ reported:

> Mr. Charles Vincent, of 1232 Druid Hill avenue is seriously ill at his home, and his relatives entertain little hope for his recovery.

On April 16, 1910, the _Afro-American_ reported:

> Mrs. Mollie Giles has moved from 1619 Druid Hill avenue to 1232 Druid Hill avenue.

On June 1, 1912 , the _Afro-American_ reported again on Mrs. Molly Giles:

> Mrs. Mollie Giles, who left for Asbury Park, N.J. Tuesday, was tendered a reception at her home, 1232 Druid Hill avenue, Monday night. A number of the members of Brown's Circle, an organization of ladies with which Mrs. Giles is connected were also present. Miss Ella Sutton, of 1234 Druid Hill avenue, accompanied Mrs. Giles.

Her return to Baltimore at the end of the summer was similarly noted.

On Jan 9, 1915, the _Afro-American_ reported on the family of Mrs. Harriett Swann:

> William Swann, of the United States Navy, is visiting relatives at 1232 Druid Hill avenue.

The next year, on May 27, 1916, the _Afro-American_ reported:

> Mr. and Mrs. Woods have returned home after spending a fortnight with Mrs. Woods' mother, Mrs. Harriett Swann at her home 1232 Druid Hill avenue.

Perhaps because the proximity to Bethel AME Church and Union Baptist Church, the _Afro-American_ reported on January 5, 1929 under the headline “Inquiring Reporter Asks Baltimore Citizens Their Main Intention For 1929,” 

> Rev. J.E. Lee, 1232 Druid Hill avenue: "To be of a greater service to my fellow man."

Around this same time, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue became offices for Mount Zion Cemetery, as H.E. Walden, then cemetery superintendent, advertised in the  _Afro-American_ on February 16, 1929:

> Mount Zion Cemetery Notice! All lot owner in the Mount Zion Cemetery please communicate with the office in the next thirty days.

The _Afro-American_ newspaper reported on March 8, 1930:

> Redemption of her maiden name was granted Mrs. Ida Barber, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue along with her decree of divorce from George Barber. Mrs. Barber was formerly Miss Ida King. She was married June 12, 1916, and abandoned June 4, 1920. There are no children.

By 1938, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue was a advertised for rent for $6.50 [a week? a month? advertisement is unclear]. Other properties advertised in same listing included: 2437 N. Charles Street, 1417 Mt. Royal Avenue, 1127 Druid Hill Avenue, 1215 Park Avenue, 2119 St. Paul Street, 2803 Rayner.

**Note**: We are still researching the later history of the property up until Bethel AME Church took control of the building in the late 1970s [?].

# History of Upton/Marble Hill

**Note**: The following section provides a broader neighborhood context to explain the significance of the Joseph C. Briscoe House to Baltimore’s social and architectural history. This section is still a work in progress and includes substantial excerpts from secondary sources in addition to primary sources that have not yet been fully developed.

## Population Movement: 1890s – 1910s

On Oct 21, 1899, the _Baltimore Sun_ reported on a meeting on Druid Hill Avenue, “COLORED VOTERS: A Declaration Of Independence Made At Tunstell's Hall,” writing:

> A meeting of independent colored voters of the Fourth Congressional district -was held last night at Tunstell's Hall, 435 Druid Hill avenue, to consider the position to be taken by such voters in the approaching election.

In 1906, Colonel C. Baker Clotworthy, commander of the Fifth Regiment:

> I would be deeply interested in this improvement because it means so much more than simply tearing down some houses and opening a street. Everyone in the city is familiar with the steady decrease which has taken place in the value of property in this neighborhood for the last 20 years.
> All about Richmond Market, and extending north, there are hundreds of undesirable houses and, in many cases, huts. This sore is spreading rapidly. A great many negroes, not of the best class,  gradually tenant the houses on the edge of this district and immediately the white people move from the block invaded. If this continues no one knows where it will stop.

### December 20, 1910: West Segregation Ordinance approved by Baltimore City Council

The following section includes extensive notes and excerpts from a 2006 study of the transnational roots of housing segregation in Baltimore by Nightingale.

> Two weeks later, on December 20, Baltimore Mayor John Barry Mahool signed into law the so-called West Segregation Ordinance, named after its sponsor in City Council Samuel L. West. The measure divided every street in Baltimore into "white blocks" and "colored blocks," based on the "race" of the majority of their inhabitants at the time of the Ordinance's passage. It set a penalty of one hundred dollars and up to a year in the Baltimore City Jail for anyone who moved on to a block set aside for the "opposite race," except black servants who lived in the houses of their white employers.[^1]

> In addition to Councilman West and Mayors Mahool and Preston, there were five other key players: Milton Dashiell, a lawyer who had a hand in writing every version of the law; Edgar Alien Poe, the City Solicitor (and great-nephew of the famous author) who repeatedly vouched for the constitutionality of the ordinance; William Luke Marbury, another, much more prominent lawyer who testified on behalf of the ordinance from the beginning and who helped Dashiell rewrite it twice during the spring of 1911 after it ran into trouble in the local courts; Charles H. Grasty, editor of the Baltimore News from the 1890s and, as of 1910, owner and editor of the venerable Baltimore Sun, whose progressive editorial pages bristled with endorsements for the ordinance throughout the process; and William Cabell Bruce, the prominent Maryland politician and race theorist, who played an important role in the career of most of the other players. [^2]

> Baltimore's growth reflected, in great part, the expansion of its already relatively substantial black population, which by 1910 numbered around 80,000 and was the country's second biggest after New Orleans. During the first decades of the century, large numbers of black people had moved into an area adjoining the "favored fan" to the southwest. Most were poor, and they crowded into congested places like Biddle Alley, which emptied into Druid Hill Avenue, the southern boundary of the Northwest Side, a street which had become largely black it? self. Others, like the NAACP's W. Ashbie Hawkins and his law partner George F. McMechen, were well-to-do enough to afford houses in the Northwest Side itself.24 In June 1910, Hawkins bought the house at 1834 McCulloh Street (one of the diagonal spokes of the favored fan) and rented it to McMechen.[^3]

> On July 5th, white residents of the Northwest Side gathered in a mass meeting. They founded the McCulloh Street, Madison Avenue, and Eutaw Place Prop? erty Protective Association (MMEPPA) and were joined in their protest shortly afterward by numerous similar groups, including the Northwest Improvement Association of Baltimore, and the Harlem Improvement Association, based in another white middle-class neighborhood nearby where Hawkins himself had settled.25 Petitions began circulating throughout the neighborhoods for imme? diate help from the city, calling for segregation to stop the "negro invasion" of the Northwest Side.[^4]

> Jim Crow ordinances segregating rail and trolley cars, theaters, restaurants and other public amenities signaled Southern whites' final rejection of physical proximity as a method of social control, and their embrace of distance. While white Baltimoreans struggled to implement such laws, they also more firmly closed off access to the social clubs and the professional societies that might have allowed Negro lawyers and doctors to better establish their reputations.[^5]

> Then, three years later, during the summer of 1913, Ashbee Hawkins used a test case to convince a Court of Appeals to void the third version of the ordinance on a technical point, and Mayor Preston was unable to assemble city council to return from vacation to pass a new law. Neighborhood associations sent a flood of letters and petitions to Preston's office ruing Marbury's incompetence and replete with warnings of "invasion," "lawlessness," "racial antagonism and animosity, conflict and disorder," as well as "bitterness and hatred" brought about by "the forced effort to force social equality by mingling the habitations of white and black races." One letter writer, a woman who ran a novelty shop, asked Preston to "find some way short of wholesale murder to get rid of the invaders."[^6]

Nightingale continued to quote an “unpublished column attacking the West Ordinance” by “celebrated Baltimore contrarian (and inveterate racist) H.L. Mencken,” who wrote:

> ”Who ever heard of a plan for decent housing for negroes in Baltimore? ... The persons who govern us have never looked into this matter. When the darky now tries to move out of his sty… into human habitation a policeman now stops him. The law practically insists that he keep on incubating typhoid and tuberculosis ... for the delight and benefit of the whole town"[^7]

> When in triumph, progressive elites joined in organizing the first City- Wide Congress of Baltimore, on three days in March, 1911, as segregationists geared up to push for yet another version of the West Ordinance, their collec? tive stand must have been clear to the black community. Johns Hopkins Medi? cal School luminary Dr. William H. Welch shared vice-presidential duties, and later the lectern, with the "negro problem" theorist William Cabell Bruce. The MMEPPA, the Northwest Improvement Association, the Harlem Improvement Association, and no less than twenty-seven other white neighborhood home- owner groups were all cordially invited, but no black minister, city councilman, or any representative of the NAACP. On days like those, racial segregationists could camouflage themselves cozily amongst Baltimore's grand crusaders for urban reform. (p.680)

The relationship between racial transition and racial segregation is clear beginning in 1910 when Baltimore became the first city in the United States to enact a law requiring racial segregation. In response to the attempt by George W. F. McMechen to move onto the 1800 block of McCulloh Street in 1910, Baltimore established a formal segregation ordinance which forbid black residents from moving to designated “white blocks” and white residents from moving to designated “colored blocks.” 

On December 20, 1910, Baltimore Mayor John Barry Mahool signed into law the West Segregation Ordinance, named for sponsor Council Samuel L. West, which identified each block in the city according to the racial identity of the majority of each block’s residents in 1910. While the West Segregation Ordinance was soon overturned as unconstitutional, its passage and the multiple subsequent attempts to enact a municipal law to enforce racial segregation reflected the deep resistance of white Baltimore residents to racial integration. As a consequence, the area of Old West Baltimore, including the neighborhoods of Harlem Park, Sandtown-Winchester, and Upton, became a predominantly African American community and together with a segregated area in East Baltimore some of the only areas open to African American residents.

In 1910, the  _Afro-American_, reported under the headline, “OBJECT TO LIVING NEAR RESPECTABLE NEGROES,” writing:

> Riot and every othar sort of intimidation were hinted at by the white people who crowded the First Branch City Council chamber last Monday, when a hearing…[^8]
