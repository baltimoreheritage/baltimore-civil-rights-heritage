# Significance Summary: 1232 Druid Hill Avenue

The Joseph C. Briscoe/George W. King House at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue is a three-story brick rowhouse erected around 1868. 1232 Druid Hill Avenue is one of many large rowhouses erected in the area now known as the Upton neighborhood during the development of Baltimore’s northwestern suburbs following the end of the U.S. Civil War. George W. King, a prominent local printer, lived at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue beginning as early as 1887 up until his death in 1898.

In the late 1890s and early 1900s, the population of the neighborhood changed as many white residents left the area and African American households occupied and purchased homes on Druid Hill Avenue and nearby streets. Joseph C. Briscoe, a waiter, teacher, and, eventually, the principal of the Colored Vocational Training School, lived at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue with his brother’s family in the early 1900s before he married and moved to the 1500 block of Druid Hill Avenue.

Following Joseph Briscoe, the building provided a residence to scores of black Baltimoreans up through the 1960s. Most recently, the building has been used by Bethel A.M.E. Church and the building continues to serve as an important reminder of the history of the Upton neighborhood.

# Property History: 1232 Druid Hill Avenue

Following the end of the U.S. Civil War in 1865, Baltimore began expanding into the northwestern suburbs between the city’s center and Druid Hill Park (established five years earlier in 1860). Suburban developers built home for wealthy residents seeking fashionable residences around Eutaw Place or Lafayette Square, far away from the crowded blocks around the harbor. Beginning in 1859, new horsecar lines provided the transportation required to connect suburban enclaves with the city’s fast-growing commercial and industrial enterprises and service on these lines continued to increase into the 1870s and 1880s.

The history of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue reflects these broader patterns of growth. On April 1, 1864, Baltimore Mayor John Lee Chapman approved an ordinance changing the name of Ross Street between Eutaw Street and North Avenue to Druid Hill Avenue. Development reached the 1200 block of Druid Hill Avenue in November 1867, as noted in a _Sun_ classified advertisement published on November 13:

> FOR SALE—One of those five new HOUSES on Druid Hill avenue, between Dolphin and Lanvale streets, just finished in the best manner, running back to a 16 foot paved alley. Apply to GEO. T. GOSNELL, on the premises.

The advertisement is closely followed with a move by the Baltimore City Commissioner's Office on November 27, 1867 to open nearby streets, noted in the _Sun_:

> Upon application to establish the lines and grade of Lanvale street, between Druid Hill avenue and Division street, notice is hereby given that the City Commissioner and Surveyor will meet on the premises on WEDNESDAY, the 4th of December, at 10 o'clock A.M., for that purpose. By order, GEO. P. WOODWARD Clerk to the City Commissioner

On August 30, 1867, the _Sun_ reported on “Dwelling Improvements in the Western Section,” writing:

> On Madison avenue, McCulloh street, Druid Hill avenue, Davidson street, McMechin and other streets, handsome dwellings are rapidly going up on lots which were but a few years ago open fields. Rufus Bennett, builder and owner, has just finished six on Druid Hill avenue, which are regarded as most stylish residences. On McMechin street, near the avenue, the same builder has five more in an advanced stage of completion, whilst three at Druid Hill avenue and Lanvale street and two at Lafayette square are under roof, under his superintendence.

The builder Rufus Bennett had a long and active career in Baltimore. The _Sun_ commented on his death on July 22, 1906, writing:

> Mr. Rufus Bennett, one of the oldest residents of the city and for years prominent in business circles, died at 6 A.M. yesterday at his home, 520 West Biddle street. General debility was the cause of his death.
> Born in Carroll county, near Waters Mill, 82 years ago, Mr. Bennett was the son of the late William Bennett. He acquired his education at the public schools in the county and, when 17 years old, came to this city to learn a trade. He apprenticed himself with a contractor and builder and, about 55 years ago, opened an office for himself.

By 1868, home building included the east side of Druid Hill Avenue between Dolphin and Lanvale Street seen in classified advertisements published in May 1868. On September 11, 1868, the _Sun_ ran an advertisement stating:

> For Sale—Three of those beautiful HOUSES on Druid Hill avenue, near Lanvale street, containing all modern conveniences and built out of the very best materials. Apply to the owners, HUBMER & WEBER ...

By 1887, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue was the residence of George W. King, a prominent local printer. King evidently engaged in speculative development within the neighborhood, as he rented and repeatedly tried to sell a property at 2118 Druid Hill Avenue.  The _Baltimore Sun_  published a classified advertisement on Feb 4, 1887:

> 2118 Druid Hill Avenue, 10 rooms, large parlor, dry cellar, nice yard. Apply 1232 DRUID HILL AVENUE.

King advertised his property at 2118 Druid Hill Avenue for sale on May 16, 1891 with the description, “cable road passes door; rents for $25.” Evidently finding no buyers, King continued to advertise the property for rent on October 8, 1896.

Around this same time, the row house next door to George King’s home, 1234 Druid Hill Avenue, sold and the owners converted the home into a boarding house. 1234 Druid Hill Avenue is advertised on August 15, 1888 as a “FIRST-CLASS DWELLING,”:

> Three-story DWELLING, front and rear, No. 1234 Druid Hill avenue, corner Lanvale street, 20 feet 6 inches front; all modern conveniences.
> JOHN GLENN & CO., 12 St. Paul street.

A subsequent classified advertisement appearing in the _Sun_ on April 9, 1890 noted:

> COMMUNICATING AND SINGLE ROOMS, with BOARD, also TABLE BOARD
> No 1234 DRUID HILL AVENUE, corner Lanvale st.

In addition to his work as a printer and small scale investor, George King also volunteered as an election judge for the 3rd, 4th and 7th precincts (according to a list appearing in the  _Baltimore Sun_ on September 19, 1889).

George W. King died in November 1898, with an obituary appearing in the _Baltimore Sun_ on November 14, 1898:

> Mr. George W. King, founder of the firm of King Brothers, printers, died early Saturday morning at his home, 1232 Druid Hill avenue. Mr. King was one of the oldest active printers in the city. He was born seventy-two years ago, and at the age of seventeen years he began his apprenticeship. Upon reaching his majority he founded the firm of King Brothers. For a number of years the firm had exclusive charge of the printing for the city, and many official books came from their press.

King’s death in 1898 coincided with the broader transition of district (now known as Upton or Marble Hill) population from largely white, European American households to become largely African American. King’s family decided to rent the property to Abraham Briscoe  (b. 1888) and his family, including brothers Joseph Briscoe (b. 1873) and John Briscoe (b. 1870). The 1900 Federal Census recorded Abraham’s occupation as a “Wagon Driver” and both Joseph and John each listing occupations as “Waiter.”

Just three years earlier, according to an 1897 city directory, Abraham Briscoe had lived at 1419 Maryland Avenue. Abraham Briscoe was a founding member of the "Ancient United Order Sons and Daughters, Brothers and Sisters of Moses," along with James M. Seward, Solomon A. Bond, John W. Henson, Louis H. Davenport, Andrew E. Bolden, Andrew A. Spriggs, Dennis Hall, John H. Bailey, James Harris and Andrew Johnson ("all colored" according to the Baltimore Sun on December 17, 1900).

The move exemplifies the new opportunities created by African American resistance to individuals and organizations that sought to promote the racial segregation of Baltimore’s housing. On January 10, 1903, the _Afro-American_ published an account of “A New Year's Eve Reception” at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue:

> Messrs Joseph Briscoe and Columbus Ramsey entertained many of their friends at dinner, Wednesday evening, December 31st, at the former's residence 1232 Druid Hill Ave. The dining and drawing rooms were artistically decorated with holly, evergreen and smilax, while large potted plants completed the decoration. The Menu which was nicely prepared but more nicely consumed, consisted of oysters on the shell, bouillon, turkey stuffed with chestnuts, Smithfield ham, hominy on chafing, individual ices and beverages to the course. At the stroke of twelve the guest knelt down in silent prayer which was lead by Mr. Abram Briscoe.

On February 14, 1903, the _Afro_ observed:

> A very delightful tea was given last Sunday evening by the Misses Briscoe at their residence, 1232 Druid Hill Ave.

It is unclear precisely when the Briscoe household remained living at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue. Joseph C. Briscoe moved away around 1903 to study at the Hampston Institute and lived in Denton, Maryland before returning to Baltimore after his marriage in 1909. By 1910, Abraham and Harriet Briscoe lived at 524 Laurens Street where Harriet died on October 14, 1910. In 1918, according to a city directory, Abraham Briscoe remained at 524 Laurens Street. 524 Laurens Street appears to be associated with the family as early as 1904, as the Afro American noted on October 22, 1904:

> Mrs. Ella B. Morris, of 524 Laurens street, returned home last week after an extended trip in the mountains. She left the city again last week, in company with her brother, Mr. Pinkney Briscoe, to attend the annual convention of the Order of Moses which is in session in Brooklyn, N.Y.

On October 13, 1906, the Afro American reported:

> Mrs. Ella B. Morris and Mr. Abraham Briscoe are delegates to the Annual encampment of the Order of Moses, which meets in Troy, N.Y., next week.

The _Afro American_ published an account of “Summer Work of the Fresh Air and Empty Stocking Circle” by Miss Ida R. Cummings, President (resident of 1234 Druid Hill Avenue) and Mrs. Mamie R. Bruce, Secretary  on November 3, 1906, that noted:

> Among the latest contributions received were $5.45 from a Lawn Party given by the Misses Briscoe's Druid Hill avenue.

One _Sun_ article from December 21, 1907 identifies 1232 Druid Hill Avenue as the residence of Charles H. Gantt (potentially a boarder or long-term guest of the Briscoe family?).

On July 17, 1909, the Afro-American updated readers in their column on "Personal Notes," writing:

> Miss Theresa Briscoe, of Druid Hill avenue, who has been confined to her home during the past week, is out again.

Perhaps Abraham Briscoe moved to New York, as the _Afro American_ noted on August 14, 1909:

> Mr. A. Edward Briscoe, formerly of this city, but now of New York spent a very pleasant fortnight here visiting relatives and friends.

Additional detail on Joseph C. Briscoe and his significance as an educator and community leader is provided in the following “Contextual History” section of this report.

The Briscoe household appears to be the first black family to live in 1232 Druid Hill Avenue and the last single-family household to occupy the property before George King (or some other owner) converted the building into three apartments. The conversion of the building into apartments around 1909 reflects the continuing changes in the neighborhood as a growing number of working-class African Americans sought and found housing in West Baltimore, particularly as the city’s black population grew during the early 20th century. 

By October 4, 1908, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue was up for sale, advertised under “Real Estate for Sale” in the _Baltimore Sun_: 

> ONLY $1,000.00 FOR 816 N. BOND ST., $2,500 for 1232 DRUID HILL AVE., $1,350 for 559 LAURENS ST.; Houses, small and large, in every section of the city for sale on very easy terms. C. MORTON, 209 St. Paul street.

Evidently, the 1908 sale attempt proved unsuccessful as George W. King Jr. retained ownership through at least 1912. On May 20, 1912, a second advertisement for the property appeared in the _Sun_:

> FOR SALE—DWELLING 1232 DRUID HILL AVE. Apply GEORGE W. KING / 31 South Howard street.

On August 9, 1912, the property was advertised for sale in the _Afro-American_:

> In Fee—400 E. 25th, 1213 W. Lexington near Franklin Square; also 1232 Druid Hill ave., 609 N. Calhoun, opposite Harlem Square. CHARLES MORTON, 209 St. Paul St.

On February 26, 1910, the _Afro-American_ reported:

> Mr. Charles Vincent, of 1232 Druid Hill avenue is seriously ill at his home, and his relatives entertain little hope for his recovery.
I
On April 16, 1910, the _Afro-American_ reported:

> Mrs. Mollie Giles has moved from 1619 Druid Hill avenue to 1232 Druid Hill avenue.

On June 1, 1912 , the _Afro-American_ reported again on Mrs. Molly Giles:

> Mrs. Mollie Giles, who left for Asbury Park, N.J. Tuesday, was tendered a reception at her home, 1232 Druid Hill avenue, Monday night. A number of the members of Brown's Circle, an organization of ladies with which Mrs. Giles is connected were also present. Miss Ella Sutton, of 1234 Druid Hill avenue, accompanied Mrs. Giles.

Her return to Baltimore at the end of the summer was similarly noted.

On Jan 9, 1915, the _Afro-American_ reported on the family of Mrs. Harriett Swann:

> William Swann, of the United States Navy, is visiting relatives at 1232 Druid Hill avenue.

The next year, on May 27, 1916, the _Afro-American_ reported:

> Mr. and Mrs. Woods have returned home after spending a fortnight with Mrs. Woods' mother, Mrs. Harriett Swann at her home 1232 Druid Hill avenue.

In the 1910s and 1920s, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue is home working-class African Americans whose lives can be read in part through advertisements appearing in the _Baltimore Sun_ under “Situation Wanted—Female.” For example, on March 27, 1909, a resident listed an advertisement seeking work:

> LAUNDRESS WANTS LAUNDRY WORK; finery specialty; housecleaning by day; can give references. 1232 DRUID HILL AVE.

This advertisement may have been placed by Nellie Peaker, a resident of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue in 1913, whose occupation was listed in the city directory of that year as a dressmaker. Her neighbors includes William [last name illegible] listed in the same directory as a porter.

On January 29, 1923, another resident sought work with an advertisement under “Situations—Male,” stating:

> CHAUFFEUR, first-class, wishes position with private family; 3 years' reference from last employer. 1232 Druid Hill ave.

On September 1, 1923, a young women advertised under “Under Situations—Female,” noting:

> GIRL (colored), place Cook or Chambermaid; stay nights. 1232 DRUID HILL AVE.

On September 11, 1923, another resident advertised under “Situations—Female,” noting:

> A VERY intelligent colored High School Girl wishes job in private family of the school. Apply 1232 DRUID HILL AVE. First Floor.

On October 25, 1939, another resident advertised under “Situations—Female,” noting:

> YOUNG WOMAN (colored) desires day's work. $1.50 and carfare. 1232 Druid Hill ave. 3rd floor.

African Americans in Baltimore, broadly excluded from employment opportunities in Baltimore’s growing industrial sector, faced particular challenges around poverty and criminal injustice. In addition, the violence common in all of Baltimore’s working class communities could also be found in the neighborhood of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue. For example, on September 12, 1909, the _Baltimore Sun_ reported under the headline “Three Shot in "Fuss" Over Woman,” writing:

> As the result of a pistol affray, Charles Coates, 429 Tyson street; Margaret Coates and Charles Clemens, 1232 Druid Hill avenue, colored were all slightly wounded yesterday morning at the house, 1232 Druid Hill avenue, and the two men were committed by Justice Tyson, at the Northwestern Police Station, on the charge of assaulting and shooting each other. The shooting occurred at about 9.15 o'clock in the morning and was concerning the woman. Clemens was shot in the left arm, Margaret Coates in the hand and Charles Coates in the hip.

Encounters between the Baltimore police and African Americans in Baltimore were often fraught, as in the example of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue resident Henry Larkins, noted as a chauffeur who appears in a report published in the _Afro-American_ on February 28, 1925:

> Thirteen men were taken in a raid on a game in the rear of 2025 Madison avenue, Saturday. The game  was in progress in a garage on the second floor of which is a chauffeur's club is conducted. […] Those who were fined $1 and costs were: […] Henry Larkins, 1232 Druid Hill avenue […]

Perhaps because the proximity to Bethel AME Church and Union Baptist Church, the _Afro-American_ reported on January 5, 1929 under the headline “Inquiring Reporter Asks Baltimore Citizens Their Main Intention For 1929,” 

> Rev. J.E. Lee, 1232 Druid Hill avenue: "To be of a greater service to my fellow man."

Around this same time, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue became offices for Mount Zion Cemetery, as H.E. Walden, then cemetery superintendent, advertised in the  _Afro-American_ on February 16, 1929:

> Mount Zion Cemetery Notice! All lot owner in the Mount Zion Cemetery please communicate with the office in the next thirty days.

The _Afro-American_ newspaper reported on March 8, 1930:

> Redemption of her maiden name was granted Mrs. Ida Barber, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue along with her decree of divorce from George Barber. Mrs. Barber was formerly Miss Ida King. She was married June 12, 1916, and abandoned June 4, 1920. There are no children.

On March 7, 1935, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue is transferred to John Stewart Morton, Sr. According to the deed, a court decision on December 20, 1934 forced the sale to Morton – who likely acted in his role as a member of the real estate and insurance firm formed as Samuel P. Morton & Son in 1868. By 1938, 1232 Druid Hill Avenue was a advertised for rent for $6.50 [a week? a month? The advertisement is unclear]. Other properties advertised in same listing included: 2437 N. Charles Street, 1417 Mt. Royal Avenue, 1127 Druid Hill Avenue, 1215 Park Avenue, 2119 St. Paul Street, 2803 Rayner.

After Morton’s death on January 10, 1957, the property passed on to his son John Stewart Morton, Sr. (d. August 3, 2011) and his wife Lettice Lee Morton (d. 2000) on November 5, 1958. The couple sold the property to Heritage Realty, Inc. on April 15, 1966. Heritage Realty, Inc. auctioned the properties, advertising 1232 Druid Hill Avenue for an auction scheduled for 11:30 am on  on Tuesday, April 26, 1966. The building is described:

> Improved by 3-story brick dwelling containing 3 apartments. Separate meters. Ground Rent $100. Deposit $500

The firm sold 1232 Druid Hill Avenue and two additional lots to a partnership including Hartford E. Bealer and Elizabeth A. Bealer, William J. Kirchiro and Sally B. Kirchiro, Richard O. Haase and Nancy B. Hasse on June 17, 1966. A second partnership composed of Edward G. McCoy, Rayfield J. Mason, Peggy A. Mason purchased the property in 1976. The next year, Rayfield and Peggy Mason bought out McCoy’s one-third interest and sold 1232 Druid Hill Avenue again to Richard Alan Mizner for $12,500 on December 7, 1978.

Minzer profitably sold the building to Station Square Developers for $20,500 on November 15, 1979. lay more modestly sold the building to Bethel AME Church on March 11, 1981 for $24,000.

# Contextual History

**Note**: The following section provides a broader neighborhood context to explain the significance of the Joseph C. Briscoe House to Baltimore’s social and architectural history. This section is still a work in progress and includes substantial excerpts from secondary sources in addition to primary sources that have not yet been fully developed.

- African Americans and Druid Hill Avenue
- Development and Change in Upton

## Joseph Cornelius Briscoe

Born on May 27, 1883 in Wilmington, North Carolina, Joseph Cornelius Briscoe graduated from the Hampton Institute in 1903 and continued on to become one of Baltimore’s foremost foremost black educators and a powerful advocate for expanding vocational training. According to an April 15, 1939 profile in the _Afro American_ by Bettye Murphy:

> Following his graduation from Hampton Institute thirty-three years ago, he planned to do contracting with a friend in California, but when asked, because of his knowledge of manual training, to accept the principalship of a school in Denton, Md., which needed also someone who could teach trades, he accepted and has been in the teaching profession ever since.
> At the Denton school, he organized a class of boys who actually did trade work as early as 1906 and 1907. This was a forerunner of the vocational work done in most schools today.

By 1918, lived at 590 Prestman Street, tall, slender man (U.S., World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918 for Joseph Cornelius Briscoe)

Joseph Cornelius Briscoe had multiple residences over the course of his life in Baltimore but 1232 Druid Hill Avenue has unique significance as his residence when he first started his career as an educator. Other residences include:

- 1524 Druid Hill Avenue (1909) - nonextant
- 590 Prestman Street (1918) - extant
- …

On February 8, 1909, the _Sun_ reported that Joseph C. Briscoe attended funeral of Mrs. Ellen Johnston Dennis, widow of U.S. Senator George R. Dennis, in Princess Anne, Maryland with Miss Ester Briscoe. [Note: is this the same Briscoe? It is unclear]

On September 11, 1909, the _Afro American_ reported on the marriage of Joseph C. Briscoe, then at teacher of “manual training in School No. 107,” and Rosa A. Savage at Wilmington, Delaware, noting the couple planned to live at 1524 Druid Hill Avenue. 

On October 3, 1909, the _Sun_ reported that Joseph Briscoe appeared in Criminal Court with Judge Harlan on charges of “Sunday gaming.” [Note: is this the same Briscoe? It is unclear]

1910, Joseph Briscoe and Rosie Briscoe, Anna Burrell (lodger) living at 1900 …

In 1925, Principal Briscoe presented at a meeting of A.M.E. Preachers held at Bethel Church, reported in the _Afro-American_ newspaper on November 21. The preachers had invited Briscoe to “give a talk on the school and the work it is doing,” and he explained that the work is “intended primarily for those boys who drop out of school instead of going to high school.” At the same meeting, Rev. Ernest Lyons “scored the management o the Community Fund for its jim crow method of attempting to collect funds from colored people,” quoting Lyons:

> They are so afraid we want to eat with them that they had a little special meeting down at the Sharp Street Community House, and furnished the dinner, I told them I had a dinner at home.

In 1932, Briscoe spoke before the Department of Public Welfare in Government of the Maryland League of Women Voters. The _Sun_ reported on November 5, 1932, writing:

> Joseph C. Briscoe, Negro principal of the Colored Vocational School, asserted that if the history of inmates of juvenile and adult penal institutions were available, a large number of cases would disclose that the individuals in question never had been trained for a job. It costs $300 a year to keep a convict imprisoned and $100 a year to education a child, he emphasized.

Another speaker, M.C. Kent, principal of the Boys’ Vocational School, noted a “net total of 3,3750 of more than 5,000 students leaving the public schools annually lack any form of training which will fit them for other than very unskilled occupations.” Edna M. Engle, principal of the Girls’ Vocational School also spoke. The audience included “social workers and representatives to the juvenile court.”

In November 1938, Joseph C. Briscoe joined a group of fifteen members of the Druid Hill avenue branch of the Baltimore Young Men’s Christian Association traveling to Washington, D.C. for a conference organized to “celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of the organization’s activities among Negroes.

- William Anderson
- J.A.H. Callie
- John T. Colbert
- T. Alexander Date
- Carrington L. Davis
- A.N. Grant

- Dr. RB. McRary
- The Rev. A.J. Mitchell
- George B. Murphy
- Dr. W.F. Noville
- Dr. A.O. Reid
- George S. Whyte
- Andrew W. Wicks

The Sun reported the list of delegates on November 2 and noted, T. Alexander Date is “the only member of the delegation who has been a member of the organization since its inception.”

On November 3, 1940, Governor O’Connor announced the appointment of four new members to the Cheltenham Board and the appointment of two others. The new members included Joseph Briscoe, then principal of the Colored Vocational School) along with:

- State Senator Charles C. Marbury (D, Prince George’s County) appointed to fill “the unexpired term of the late Dr. William H. Gibbons”
- Edward S. Lewis, “Negro, executive secretary of the Baltimore Urban League”
- Sidney R. Traub, Baltimore attorney

On December 11, 1944, the _Sun_ reported on Briscoe’s death, writing:

> Joseph C. Briscoe, Negro, principal of the George Carver Vocational Training School, died yesterday morning at his home at 1303 Madison avenue.
> He was a member of the board of Cheltenham School for Boys and of the board of the Provident Hospital.
> Funeral services will be held at 10 A.M. Wednesday at St. Katherine’s Episcopal Church.

## African Americans and Druid Hill Avenue

The significance of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue must be understand in the context of Druid Hill Avenue’s broader history of race, segregation and Civil Rights in the late 19th and early 20th century. 

See:[1876 Map](http://collection.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/14%0A)

The geography of the neighborhood now known as Upton was shaped in the late 19th century by a series of changes to Baltimore’s Ward boundaries shaped in part by efforts to minimize the electoral power of Baltimore’s African American residents. The ward boundaries changed in 1860, 1882, and 1888 — each time keeping the area divided between the 11th, 12th, and 20th wards. Finally, in 1890, a change to the boundaries of the 11th ward allowed Harry S. Cummings won office as Baltimore’s first black City Councilman.

The wards changed again (renumbered to the 13th, 14th and 15th wards) in 1899 and, in 1901, new boundaries defined the 17th, 14th and 11th Wards. 


On Oct 21, 1899, the _Baltimore Sun_ reported on a meeting on Druid Hill Avenue, “COLORED VOTERS: A Declaration Of Independence Made At Tunstell's Hall,” writing:

> A meeting of independent colored voters of the Fourth Congressional district -was held last night at Tunstell's Hall, 435 Druid Hill avenue, to consider the position to be taken by such voters in the approaching election.

Changing Ward Boundaries in 1901: [https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=z5t\_a4qx1Fv0.kRXxh401L5uA&hl=en](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=z5t_a4qx1Fv0.kRXxh401L5uA&hl=en)

1232 Druid Hill + 17th Ward (1876) bounded by Fremont, Lafayette, Mulberry & Druid Hill Ave 

In 1906, Colonel C. Baker Clotworthy, commander of the Fifth Regiment:

> I would be deeply interested in this improvement because it means so much more than simply tearing down some houses and opening a street. Everyone in the city is familiar with the steady decrease which has taken place in the value of property in this neighborhood for the last 20 years.
> All about Richmond Market, and extending north, there are hundreds of undesirable houses and, in many cases, huts. This sore is spreading rapidly. A great many negroes, not of the best class,  gradually tenant the houses on the edge of this district and immediately the white people move from the block invaded. If this continues no one knows where it will stop.

On October 27, 1909, the _Baltimore Sun_ headlined an article on the racial transition: “NEGROES ENCROACHING / Taxpayer Tells Of Conditions In Seventeenth Ward. / FINE RESIDENCES OCCUPIED / Following Booker Washington’s Advice, They Move From Alleys To The Principal Streets.” The article quoted “a well-known taxpayer of the Seventeenth ward” who advocated in favor of the “suffrage amendment” limiting voting to white Marylanders. On the topic of housing within the Seventeenth ward, the individual is quoted:

> About six years ago the negroes had taken up entirely the residences on Biddle street, important parts of Druid Hill avenue, Division and adjacent streets.
> It was thought that they would be confined to this restricted district, but not so. About a year or so ago they began to go into the upper part of Argyle avenue, Myrtle avenue, Lanvale street and Dolphin street. […]
> St. Peter’s Protestant Episcopal Church, at Druid Hill avenue and Lanvale street, is nearly surrounded by negroes.
> The fine property of St. Mary’s Seminary, one of the oldest and best-known Catholic educational institutions in the country, is in a similar situation.
> I know that because of the negro invasion fine residence properties in this section have depreciated from 30 to 50 percent, in value, and the end is not yet.

The account claimed to observe falling prices for residential real estate, noting:

> A lady had for sale a house in the 1110 block on Argyle avenue. It was valued and offered for sale at $2,400. Before she secured a purchaser negroes moved into the house next door. She was compelled and did sell her house for $1,100. I mention this to show that the fact of negroes going into this part of the ward does depreciate property values, and consequently means a loss to the city in the way of decreased revenues from taxes. 

Educational institutions (both white and black) served as particular point of concern:

> There are four negro schools in the Seventeenth ward. The negroes of this ward do not pay enough in taxes to pay for the running of these schools. Not only do they not do this, but their very presence and intrusion into strictly white streets there cause a loss to the city in taxes.

1234 Druid Hill Avenue is the former residence of Ida Rebecca Cummings (1867-1950?), an African American educator, organization leader, and clubwoman. The Encyclopedia of African-American Heritage (1997) by Susan Altman, [profiled Cummings](http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/ida-cummings-organizer-her-people) writing:

> From Baltimore, Maryland, her father was a hotel chef and catering business owner; her mother operated a boarding house at their home. Cummings was raised in an environment that stressed learning, Black unity, and community service. The family church, Metropolitan Methodist, was a station stop with Underground Railroad and offered literacy classes before the city allowed Black public schools. This atmosphere was a large part of the children’s place of academia in their early years. The Oblate Sisters of providence, an order of Black nuns, were Cummings’s first teachers.
> She later attended Hampton Institute and Morgan State College; where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1922. Cummings began teaching primary school in 1900, moving to specialized courses in her home city and Chicago. Affectionately called “Miss Ida” by her students, Cummings taught for thirty-seven years. While teaching, she participated in organizations that worked to improve housing, health care, and education for poor children. In 1904, she and other members of the Colored YMCA established the Colored Empty Stocking and Fresh Air Circle.
> They provided Christmas stockings to children who would otherwise have no gifts. The organization also aided in a healthier environment for these children by paying for boarding for them in rural homes during the summer. From 1912 to 1914, Cummings was secretary of the National Association of Colored Women and chair of the planning committee for its annual convention. She was a trustee of Bennett College, the first woman trustee of Morgan State College, and served as president of the Republican Woman’s League. Ida Cummings died in November 1958.


## Housing and African Americans in West Baltimore

### December 20, 1910: West Segregation Ordinance approved by Baltimore City Council

The following section includes extensive notes and excerpts from a 2006 study of the transnational roots of housing segregation in Baltimore by Nightingale.

> Two weeks later, on December 20, Baltimore Mayor John Barry Mahool signed into law the so-called West Segregation Ordinance, named after its sponsor in City Council Samuel L. West. The measure divided every street in Baltimore into "white blocks" and "colored blocks," based on the "race" of the majority of their inhabitants at the time of the Ordinance's passage. It set a penalty of one hundred dollars and up to a year in the Baltimore City Jail for anyone who moved on to a block set aside for the "opposite race," except black servants who lived in the houses of their white employers.[^1]

> In addition to Councilman West and Mayors Mahool and Preston, there were five other key players: Milton Dashiell, a lawyer who had a hand in writing every version of the law; Edgar Alien Poe, the City Solicitor (and great-nephew of the famous author) who repeatedly vouched for the constitutionality of the ordinance; William Luke Marbury, another, much more prominent lawyer who testified on behalf of the ordinance from the beginning and who helped Dashiell rewrite it twice during the spring of 1911 after it ran into trouble in the local courts; Charles H. Grasty, editor of the Baltimore News from the 1890s and, as of 1910, owner and editor of the venerable Baltimore Sun, whose progressive editorial pages bristled with endorsements for the ordinance throughout the process; and William Cabell Bruce, the prominent Maryland politician and race theorist, who played an important role in the career of most of the other players. [^2]

> Baltimore's growth reflected, in great part, the expansion of its already relatively substantial black population, which by 1910 numbered around 80,000 and was the country's second biggest after New Orleans. During the first decades of the century, large numbers of black people had moved into an area adjoining the "favored fan" to the southwest. Most were poor, and they crowded into congested places like Biddle Alley, which emptied into Druid Hill Avenue, the southern boundary of the Northwest Side, a street which had become largely black it? self. Others, like the NAACP's W. Ashbie Hawkins and his law partner George F. McMechen, were well-to-do enough to afford houses in the Northwest Side itself.24 In June 1910, Hawkins bought the house at 1834 McCulloh Street (one of the diagonal spokes of the favored fan) and rented it to McMechen.[^3]

> On July 5th, white residents of the Northwest Side gathered in a mass meeting. They founded the McCulloh Street, Madison Avenue, and Eutaw Place Prop? erty Protective Association (MMEPPA) and were joined in their protest shortly afterward by numerous similar groups, including the Northwest Improvement Association of Baltimore, and the Harlem Improvement Association, based in another white middle-class neighborhood nearby where Hawkins himself had settled.25 Petitions began circulating throughout the neighborhoods for imme? diate help from the city, calling for segregation to stop the "negro invasion" of the Northwest Side.[^4]

> Jim Crow ordinances segregating rail and trolley cars, theaters, restaurants and other public amenities signaled Southern whites' final rejection of physical proximity as a method of social control, and their embrace of distance. While white Baltimoreans struggled to implement such laws, they also more firmly closed off access to the social clubs and the professional societies that might have allowed Negro lawyers and doctors to better establish their reputations.[^5]

> Then, three years later, during the summer of 1913, Ashbee Hawkins used a test case to convince a Court of Appeals to void the third version of the ordinance on a technical point, and Mayor Preston was unable to assemble city council to return from vacation to pass a new law. Neighborhood associations sent a flood of letters and petitions to Preston's office ruing Marbury's incompetence and replete with warnings of "invasion," "lawlessness," "racial antagonism and animosity, conflict and disorder," as well as "bitterness and hatred" brought about by "the forced effort to force social equality by mingling the habitations of white and black races." One letter writer, a woman who ran a novelty shop, asked Preston to "find some way short of wholesale murder to get rid of the invaders."[^6]

Nightingale continued to quote an “unpublished column attacking the West Ordinance” by “celebrated Baltimore contrarian (and inveterate racist) H.L. Mencken,” who wrote:

> ”Who ever heard of a plan for decent housing for negroes in Baltimore? ... The persons who govern us have never looked into this matter. When the darky now tries to move out of his sty… into human habitation a policeman now stops him. The law practically insists that he keep on incubating typhoid and tuberculosis ... for the delight and benefit of the whole town"[^7]

> When in triumph, progressive elites joined in organizing the first City- Wide Congress of Baltimore, on three days in March, 1911, as segregationists geared up to push for yet another version of the West Ordinance, their collective stand must have been clear to the black community. Johns Hopkins Medical School luminary Dr. William H. Welch shared vice-presidential duties, and later the lectern, with the "negro problem" theorist William Cabell Bruce. The MMEPPA, the Northwest Improvement Association, the Harlem Improvement Association, and no less than twenty-seven other white neighborhood home- owner groups were all cordially invited, but no black minister, city councilman, or any representative of the NAACP. On days like those, racial segregationists could camouflage themselves cozily amongst Baltimore's grand crusaders for urban reform. (p.680)

The relationship between racial transition and racial segregation is clear beginning in 1910 when Baltimore became the first city in the United States to enact a law requiring racial segregation. In response to the attempt by George W. F. McMechen to move onto the 1800 block of McCulloh Street in 1910, Baltimore established a formal segregation ordinance which forbid black residents from moving to designated “white blocks” and white residents from moving to designated “colored blocks.” 

On December 20, 1910, Baltimore Mayor John Barry Mahool signed into law the West Segregation Ordinance, named for sponsor Council Samuel L. West, which identified each block in the city according to the racial identity of the majority of each block’s residents in 1910. While the West Segregation Ordinance was soon overturned as unconstitutional, its passage and the multiple subsequent attempts to enact a municipal law to enforce racial segregation reflected the deep resistance of white Baltimore residents to racial integration. As a consequence, the area of Old West Baltimore, including the neighborhoods of Harlem Park, Sandtown-Winchester, and Upton, became a predominantly African American community and together with a segregated area in East Baltimore some of the only areas open to African American residents.
