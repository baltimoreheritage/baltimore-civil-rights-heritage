We are working on a study of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue in response to the [recent demolition of the Freedom House](http://baltimoreheritage.org/preservation/freedom-house-demolition-is-a-wake-up-call-for-preservation-in-west-baltimore/) at 1234 Druid Hill Avenue. We've [published the draft study](/civil-rights-heritage/places/1232-druid-hill-avenue/) to help open up the process of our research, writing and documentation of this important landmark in the Upton neighborhood.

**Update – January 6, 2015:** We have moved the study of 1232 Druid Hill Avenue to [a separate page](/civil-rights-heritage/places/1232-druid-hill-avenue/). The previous version of this draft that described the property as the Joseph C. Briscoe House incorrectly confused Joseph Briscoe (b. 1873, Maryland) a waiter who lived at 1232 Druid Hill Avenue with [Joseph C. Briscoe](/civil-rights-heritage/people/joseph-cornelius-briscoe/) (b. 1883, North Carolina) who served as a noted educator and educational administrator. We have updated the title of the post and our identification of the house to reflect the association with Abraham Briscoe and his family—not Joseph C. Briscoe.
