<p>From NHL Study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, states did not have an absolutely free hand in excluding black voters. Two Supreme Court decisions upheld the power of the Federal government to prosecute suffrage violations. In Ex parte Siebold, the Court affirmed the conviction of a state election judge in Maryland who interfered with federal supervisors during an election. In Ex parte Yarbrough, the high tribunal upheld the convictions of nine members of a white terrorist group, the Pop and Go Club, who beat a black man at his home to prevent him from casting his ballot in a congressional election in Georgia.30 Speaking for the unanimous Court, Justice Samuel Miller eloquently argued: “If the government of the United States has within its constitutional domain no authority to provide against these evils . . . then, indeed, is the country in danger, and its best powers, its highest purposes, the hopes which it inspires, and the love which enshrines it, are at the mercy of the combinations of those who respect no right but brute force on the one hand, and unprincipled corrruptionists on the other.” (Ex parte Yarbrough, 667; Nieman, Promises, 99.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conventions expressing similar sentiments occurred in Augusta, Georgia; Lexington, Kentucky; Little Rock, Arkansas; Mobile, Alabama; and Washington, D.C. As with all the other gatherings, the church played an enormous role in political mobilization. For example, on January 30, 1866, the National Convention of Colored Men met at the Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., with the Reverend Henry Highland Garnet presiding. Delegates assembled from Alabama, the District of Columbia, Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and six New England states. The convention endorsed “the right of impartial suffrage” and sent a delegation, headed by the ex-slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, to meet with President Andrew Johnson, who had succeeded Lincoln. On February 6, 1866, the black emissaries declared to the president that African Americans deserved the suffrage because of the fact that “we are subjects of the Government and subject to taxation, to volunteer in the service of the country, subject to being drafted, subject to bear the burdens of the State, makes it not improper that we should ask in the privileges of this condition.” However, Johnson refused to be swayed. A Tennessee Democrat who opposed slavery not out of any moral consideration for African Americans but on the grounds that it held poor whites under the yoke of elite planters, Johnson had a very dim and racist view of African American capabilities for citizenship. He informed Douglass that granting blacks the franchise would result in “great injury to the white as well as the colored man.” Douglass disparaged the chief executive’s opinion as “unsound and prejudicial.”7</p>

<p>Notes on the Progress of the Colored People of Maryland Since the War: A …  By Jeffrey Richardson Bracket <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=W8szAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Jeffrey%20R.%20Brackett%20maryland&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q=police&amp;f=false">https://books.google.com/books?id=W8szAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Jeffrey%20R.%20Brackett%20maryland&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q=police&amp;f=false</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to note that shortly before the congressional election the chairman of both the republican and democratic state committees joined in asking the judges of election in Baltimore that fences might be erected in front of the polling windows and that the colored voters should approach on one side the whites on the other exclusively This they said would conduee to a quiet and honest election The republican chairman soon withdrew his name after finding as he stated that the plan was opposed by the United States marshal as drawing a race or color line There was opposition to it among the judges also for as votes were to be taken alternately and the white voters were many more than the colored unfairness might result to the whites especially were the polls crowded</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From NHL Study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The right to vote has held a central place in the black freedom struggle. With abolition of slavery, African Americans sought the ballot as a means to claim their first-class citizenship. When emancipated blacks pursued equality, they demanded the franchise on the same basis as that exercised by whites. Indeed, when Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic Gettysburg Address in 1863, universal white manhood suffrage existed in the North and the South. Democratic reforms over the previous half-century had whittled down property qualifications that excluded working class and poor white Americans from voting. Once slaves obtained freedom with passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, they intended to participate actively in the political process and help advance their interests. Before emancipation, blacks residing in five New England states could vote. Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which contained only 6 percent of the northern black population, had extended the right to vote to blacks. In New York, blacks owning $250 in freehold property could also cast a ballot; however, the same property qualification did not apply to whites. In the South, where the overwhelming number of African Americans labored as slaves, the right to vote was limited to whites.</p>

<h2 id="decisions-from-kentucky-louisiana">1876: Decisions from Kentucky, Louisiana</h2>
<p><em>United States v. Reese</em>, 92 U.S. 214 (1876), Kentucky</p>
<p>This was the Supreme Court’s first voting rights case heard under the Fifteenth Amendment that prohibited racial discrimination in voting rights and the Enforcement Act of 1870 that required elections be conducted without regard to race. In this case, a voting official was indicted for not casting a black man’s vote in a municipal election.  The Court found that the Fifteenth Amendment did not confer the right to vote. This ruling gave states the ability to use tests to exclude African Americans from voting.</p>
<p><em>United States v. Cruikshank</em>, 92 U.S. 542 (1876), Louisiana</p>
<p>Decided the same day as <em>United States v. Reese </em>(above), the Supreme Court ruled that the Justice Department could not use the Enforcement Act to prosecute private individuals for civil rights violations. Thus, the Federal government could only prosecute state officials. This case arose from the Colfax Massacre of 1873 when an armed white force killed African Americans at the Colfax Courthouse and the surrounding square over a contested gubernatorial election. “The <em>Cruikshank</em> opinion encouraged violence in the Reconstruction South and is one of several Supreme Court decisions that marked the nation’s retreat from Reconstruction.” (Hall, 209)</p>
<h2 id="ex-parte-yarbrough-110-u.s.-651-1884-georgia">1884: <em>Ex Parte Yarbrough</em>, 110 U.S. 651 (1884), Georgia</h2>
<p>This case held that encroaching on the voting rights of blacks violated the Fifteenth Amendment. The case arose after eight Ku Klux Klansmen beat a black man at his home for trying to vote in a federal congressional election. This decision was “exceptional in its time” as the one moment in Reconstruction when “the Supreme Court upheld federal power to punish private obstruction of someone’s voting rights.” (Hall, 946-47).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maryland’s Democratic Party was itself divided over support for the notoriously corrupt Gorman-Rasin machine, which dominated both state and local politics at the turn of the century and which had nakedly sought to use disfranchisement to eliminate the votes of white reformist Democrat detractors as well as blacks.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="republican-lloyd-lowndes-elected-governor-in-maryland">1895: Republican Lloyd Lowndes elected governor in Maryland</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The crisis began in 1895 when Republican Lloyd Lowndes carried Baltimore by over 11,000 votes and won the gubernatorial election, and when reform Republican Alcaeus Hooper became mayor of Baltimore. After this, the Democrats’ campaigns became more racist and efforts to disenfranchise blacks increased. In Baltimore City, for example, one of the displays carried in a torch-lit parade was a transparency depicting a black teacher, in an integrated classroom, flogging a white child.8 In this year Dr. John Marcus Cargill was first elected to the City Council, continuing to campaign in the face of unhidden Democratic appeals to racist sentiment. The Democratic-controlled state legislature then passed a series of laws to inhibit black voter participation. In 1904, they removed all party labels from the ballot.&quot; But that still did not prevent blacks from voting. Then, three separate disenfranchisement amendments were passed by the state legislature in 1904, 1908, and 1910.12 They used the devices of literacy clauses, grandfather clauses, and property requirements to reduce the number of black voters. All three amendments were defeated in the required referendum by an interesting combination of voters not present in such large numbers in most southern states where blacks were disenfranchised. Working against the amendments were: all blacks; most white Republicans; leaders of local reform movements, both Republican and Democratic, who sought to keep power out of the hands of the Democratic-controlled machine; and many immigrants and their leaders, sometimes even those allied with the machine, who feared that literacy tests and the grandfather clause would take away their political power as well as that of blacks.</p>

<h2 id="williams-v.-mississippi-170-u.s.-213-1898-mississippi">1898: <em>Williams v. Mississippi</em>, 170 U.S. 213 (1898), Mississippi</h2>
<p>In <em>Williams</em>, the Supreme Court validated Mississippi’s literacy test and found it lawful under the Fifteenth Amendment.  The Court ruled that the literacy test was written in a manner that did not discriminate on the basis of race, and consequently the tests themselves served as a legitimate means of discerning voter eligibility. (Not a voting rights case, this case arose when a black man, convicted of murder, claimed violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because blacks were excluded from juries since none could serve due to exclusionary tests and devices.)</p>
<h2 id="force-bill-defeated">1890: Force Bill defeated</h2>
<h1 id="section-3">1905 – 1929</h1>
<p>From NHL Study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The combination of poll taxes, secret ballots, literacy/understanding tests, grandfather clauses, and the biased manipulation of these registration procedures achieved the goal of disfranchising the overwhelming number of African Americans. Once Louisiana adopted its new constitution in 1898, the number of black voters plummeted from 130,000 to 5,000. In Virginia, the number dropped from 147,000 to 21,000. The Constitutional Convention in Mississippi cut black enrollment from approximately 147,000 to around 8,600. In 1906, five years after Alabama designed its exclusionary suffrage proposals, only 2 percent of the black voting-age population remained on the registration books.40 The last black congressman from the South until the early 1970s, George H. White of North Carolina, departed the House in 1901.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The relatively few black southerners who still could vote encountered a final hurdle in making their ballots count: the white Democratic Party primary. Once upper-class whites managed to snuff out the biracial political threat posed by the Populists, the Democratic Party again reigned supreme. Although Republicans continued to exist, and indeed blacks operated within their ranks, they posed little danger for the reunited Democrats. The class struggle that had divided wealthy and poor whites and that occasioned third parties persisted mainly within the confines of the Democratic Party. To exclude blacks from exercising renewed political leverage, white Democratic officials closed their doors to African Americans. By excluding blacks from their primaries, they stopped African Americans from voting in the sole contest that counted in the one-party Democratic South. Without the white primary, a progressive North Carolina newspaper editor explained, “the divisions among white men might result in bringing about a return to deplorable conditions when one faction of white men called upon the negroes to help defeat another faction.”   ## 1907: Cummings and campaigning</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As it did for so many aspects of civil rights, World War II boosted opportunities for expanding black suffrage. The democratic, anti-racist ideology of the war against Fascism abroad prompted blacks to pursue a “Double V” campaign for victory both abroad and over white supremacy at home. The participation of black troops on the ground, albeit in segregated units, as well as the heroic combat record of the Tuskegee Airmen, the specially trained unit of black pilots, provided palpable arguments for extending full citizenship rights to African Americans. Although the war heightened black expectations of securing the right to vote, it did not guarantee that a half- century of disenfranchisement would end. Fulfilling the promises of the Fifteenth Amendment would take more than wartime rhetoric to achieve; it would require litigation, lobbying, and direct action. Even then, it would take another twenty years after the end of World War II before the majority of black southerners obtained the right to vote.</p>

<h2 id="united-states-v.-classic-313-u.s.-299-1941-louisiana">1941: <em>United States v. Classic</em>, 313 U.S. 299 (1941), Louisiana</h2>
<p>In this case, the Supreme Court found that Congress could regulate primary and general elections for federal office.  Brought forth by the newly created Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, the decision made the ruling in <em>Smith v. Allwright </em>(below) inevitable.   ## 1944: <em>Smith v. Allwright</em>, 321 U.S. 649 (1944), Texas</p>
<p>In a case presented by the NAACP, the Supreme Court reversed its decision in <em>Grovey</em> (above) and found the white primary unconstitutional.  “Constitutional scholars cite <em>Allwright</em> as one of the seminal cases in the development of the ‘public function’ concept.” After <em>Allwright</em>, cases concentrated on individual rights to vote, as opposed to group rights, through literacy tests and poll taxes.  (Hall, 800)</p>

<p>Extending its ruling in <em>Smith v. Allwright </em>(above) a federal circuit court found that party primaries were public events “from which African Americans could not be excluded.”  (Luker, 219)</p>
<h2 id="davis-v.-schnell-81-f.-supp.-872-s.d.-ala.-1949schnell-v.-davis-336-u.s.-933-1949-alabama">1949: <em>Davis v. Schnell</em>, 81 F. Supp. 872 (S.D. Ala., 1949); <em>Schnell v. Davis</em>, 336 U.S. 933 (1949), Alabama</h2>
<p>A federal district court restricted voter registrars from using a literacy test to arbitrarily discriminate against blacks.  The decision was sustained by the U.S. Supreme Court.  (Luker, 70)</p>
<h2 id="south-v.-peters-339-u.s.-276-1950-georgia">1950: <em>South v. Peters</em>, 339 U.S. 276 (1950), Georgia</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Georgia’s county unit system of voting. In statewide elections, this system gave an advantage to voters in the state’s many small rural counties and was disadvantageous to voters in the fewer urban counties where African Americans were more likely registered to vote. The Court overturned this decision in 1962 and 1964.  (See _Baker v. Carr _and _Reynolds v. Sims _below.)</p>
<h2 id="terry-v.-adams-345-u.s.-461-1953-texas">1953: <em>Terry v. Adams</em>, 345 U.S. 461 (1953), Texas</h2>
<p>This case was the last of the “white primary” cases that “provided a precedent for Congressional proscription of private racial discrimination under the Fifteenth Amendment in later federal legislation such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965.” (Hall, 865)</p>
<h1 id="section-7">1954 – 1968</h1>

<p>“Racial designations on ballots violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection requirement.”  (Luker, 170)  The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear this case.   ## 1960: Cases from Alabama, Georgia</p>
<p><em>Gomillion v. Lightfoot</em>, 364 U.S. 339 (1960), Alabama</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court found unconstitutional an Alabama statute that redrew the city boundaries of Tuskegee with the effect of excluding almost all of the city’s four hundred black voters, but none of its white voters.  The case “[s]et a precedent for Federal judicial intervention in state redistricting and for later one-person, one-vote decisions that would affect legislative apportionments across the country.” The issue was taken up more directly in <em>Reynolds </em>(1964, below). (Luker, 103)   <em>United States v. Raines</em>, 362 U.S. 17 (1960), Georgia</p>
<p>“Court upheld constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 that authorized the attorney general to seek a federal court injunction against persons who deprived others of the right to vote because of their race.” (Luker, 268)</p>
<h2 id="case-from-tennessee-alabama">1962: Case from Tennessee, Alabama</h2>
<p>  <em>Baker v. Carr</em>, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), Tennessee</p>
<p>The Court declared “that apportionment issues were cognizable under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.” (Hall, 164)   <em>Kennedy v. Bruce</em>, 298 F.2d 860 (5th Cir., 1962), Alabama</p>
<p>This case gave the Justice Department authority to review local voter registration lists if reasonable grounds existed showing that some citizens were denied the right to vote.   ## 1963:<em>Gray v. Sanders</em>, 372 U.S. 368 (1963), Georgia</p>
<p>This Supreme Court case “proved to be the jurisprudential steppingstone between <em>Baker v. Carr</em> (1962, above) and the 1964 legislative reapportionment cases.”  (Hall, 346)</p>
<h2 id="reynolds-v.-sims-377-u.s.-533-1964-alabama">1964:<em>Reynolds v. Sims</em>, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), Alabama</h2>
<p>The Court found that “[r]eapportionment of state legislatures which disenfranchises any citizen is unconstitutional and that federal courts had the authority to prevent it.” (Luker, 218) The Court “embraced the principle of equal representation for equal number of votes.” (Hall, 900)</p>
<h2 id="cases-from-louisiana-georgia-virginia-mississippi">1965: Cases from Louisiana, Georgia, Virginia, Mississippi</h2>
<p><em>United States v. Ward</em>, 352 F.2d 329 (5th Cir., 1965), Louisiana The “Court froze restrictive voter registration requirements in Louisiana for two years. . . . to allow all applicants to be registered under the less restrictive requirements that were applied to white applicants.”  (Luker, 270)   <em>Fortson v. Dorsey</em>, 379 U.S. 433 (1965), Georgia The Court found that multimember districts may be unconstitutional in some instances.   <em>Harman v. Forssenius</em>, 380 U.S. 528 (1965), Virginia The Court found unconstitutional the state’s attempt to levy a poll tax. (Luker, 113)   <em>Louisiana v. United States</em>, 380 U.S. 145 (1965), Louisiana Even though the Court had earlier (1949) affirmed a lower court’s decision invalidating Alabama’s understanding test, several southern states persisted in the practice. <em>Louisiana</em> struck down the practice of understanding tests. (Hall, 886)   <em>United States v. Lynd</em>, 349 F.2d 785 (5th Cir., 1965), Mississippi The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the state’s voter registrar to end discrimination against African American applicants.   ## 1966: Cases from South Carolina, Virginia, and New York</p>
<p><em>South Carolina v. Katzenbach</em>, 383 U.S. 301 (1966), South Carolina The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 after South Carolina sought to prevent enforcement of some of the act’s provisions such as banning literacy tests for voter registration.  (Luker, 241) The case was “a milestone in the development of congressional power to enforce the Civil War Amendments.” (Hall, 805-06)   <em>Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections</em>, 383 U.S. 663 (1966), Virginia The Supreme Court found the state’s poll tax unconstitutional in state and local elections. This ruling’s impact was limited since only three other states used poll taxes (Alabama, Texas, and Mississippi).  (Hall, 366)   <em>Katzenbach v. Morgan</em>, 384 U.S. 641 (1966), New York The Supreme Court determined that Congress had authority to prohibit literacy tests. A New York resident had sued the Attorney General to prevent those Puerto Ricans who lacked familiarity with the English language from</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1971, an African American, George Russell, the incumbent city solicitor and a former state trial judge, challenged William Donald Schaefer, the powerful former president of the City Council, for the Democratic nomination. Russell built a multicultural coalition and had solid support amongst older, middle-class black Baltimoreans. However, Clarence Mitchell III, an incumbent state senator and scion of the Jackson-Mitchell clan, soon entered the race, and garnered the support of younger African Americans. His entrance effectively split the black vote, allowing Schafer to become mayor, beginning a long reign that did not end until he retired in 1986.633 Disappointed but not defeated, African Americans’ attempts to acquire other important city administration positions began that same year and were successful with the appointment of Roland Patterson as school superintendent in 1971. Three black Baltimoreans were later appointed to the school board in 1975, along with a new African American superintendent, John L. Crew. These victories gave African Americans a majority on the school board for the first time in history.</p>
