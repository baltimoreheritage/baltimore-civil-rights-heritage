In _PRECURSORS OF ROSA PARKS: MARYLAND TRANSPORTATION CASES BETWEEN THE CIVIL WAR AND THE BEGINNING OF WORLD WAR I_, historian David Bogen reflected on the importance of early activism around transportation and public accommodation, writing:
> When Rosa Parks refused to move to a seat in the back of the bus in Montgomery, it sparked a boycott and was a critical event in the Civil Rights movement.' But Mrs. Parks was not the first African American to resist segregation. Mary Anderson, Aaron Bradley, Josephine Carr, Harriet E. Cully, John W. Fields, Professor W. H.H. Hart, Ellen Jackson, Annie A. Jakes, James Jenkins, Reverend Harvey Johnson, Reverend Robert McGuinn, the Stewart sisters, Alexander Thompson, and Thomas W. Turner were among the many teachers, ministers, businessmen, and ordinary citizens who refused to accept second class treatment on Maryland's waterways and rails.

One category of public accommodation that deserves special note is the relationship of public accommodation to public health. This may involve access to hospitals, health centers or the offices of professional physicians but also has a broader meaning for the way in which black people were conceived as a threat to public health at various times.

# 1831-1870

In Precursors of Rosa Parks, David Bogen remarks:
> Prior to the Civil War, segregation in transportation was primarily a Northern phenomenon, which was on the decline. In the South, slaves rode with their masters so as to be available to provide services, while laws to prevent escapes discouraged solo travel by blacks of any status.
> The enactment of the Civil Rights Act on April 9, 1866, spurred African-American resistance. If transportation facilities did not exclude free blacks, they were likely to segregate the few who traveled. Slavery's abolition was swiftly accompanied by the rise of broader segregation The Act provided that citizens of every race and color were entitled to the same right to make and enforce contracts as was enjoyed by white citizens. This created a plausible argument that discrimination in offering contracts for public accommodations violated the federal statute.

David Bogen summarizes the Baltimore City Passenger Railway cases, writing:
> About one car in three permitted African Americans to ride, but the railway permitted whites to ride in all cars.93 In February of 1871, John W. Fields, a black barber visiting Baltimore from Virginia, was ejected from a car that did not have such a sign. 4 He responded by filing suit in United States circuit court, with Mr. Presstman as his attorney.95 The case was tried before Judge Giles and Judge Hugh Lennox Bond (appointed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals by President Ulysses Grant as a reward for his conduct during the Civil War and on the bench in Baltimore). 96 Judge Bond charged the jury that if the company refused to transport Fields solely because he was black, he should be awarded damages.97 That charge marked the end of segregation on horsecar trolleys, because afterwards the trolley companies found it too expensive to have separate cars for African Americans in the same numbers and with the same convenience as cars restricted to whites.98 Thus, Fields' victory integrated municipal transit in Baltimore.

## 1910s: Efforts to enact segregation on Baltimore City trolleys

> Meanwhile, a Jim Crow rail coach law did squeak through the Maryland legislature in 1904 despite the heroic and nearly successful resistance efforts of Dr. Lyon on the eve of his departure to Liberia. A boycott and a lawsuit by well-to do blacks from Maryland and Washington D.C. later restricted it to intra-state travel only. Other Jim Crow statutes, such as a Baltimore City trolley segregation ordinance, languished into the mid-1910s, with the NAACP and Ashbee Hawkins fighting them every step of the way.[^1]
