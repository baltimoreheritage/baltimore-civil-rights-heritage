<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In 1831, over 17,888 free people of color and 10,653 enslaved African Americans called Baltimore home.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Free black men and women living in Maryland could not vote nor testify in any criminal trial.<span class="citation" data-cites="maryland_state_archives_guide_2007"><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> These men and women paid taxes but their children could not attend Baltimore’s new public schools. White employers excluded black workers from all but the most difficult and dangerous jobs in the city’s growing industrial economy.</p>
<p>Black Baltimoreans largely lived outside the center of the city as historian Christopher Phillips observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although as late as 1810 nearly half of the city’s free Negroes lived in the central wards, by 1830 less than 10 percent resided in that part of the city. The largest number moved to the western precincts, where developers had responded to the population boom by laying out new streets and erecting cheap tenement housing.<span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_freedoms_1997"><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While not wholly segregated, many free black residents lived among the “maze of alleyways and court-yards” where “black family dwellings interspersed with those of laboring and poor whites.”<span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_freedoms_1997"><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Continuing the early efforts of Baltimore’s free and enslaved black residents to build and sustain churches and fraternal organizations, residents came together at Bethel AME Church on Saratoga Street near Gay Street and at Sharp Street Street Church near Pratt Street. More than any other place in Baltimore before the U.S. Civil War, churches served as the center of education, mutual support, and early activism. Advocacy took a different form than the Civil Rights movement in the twentieth century, as historian Lawrence H. Mamiya observes when reflecting on the legacy of pastor Rev. Daniel Payne, pastor of Bethel AME Church from 1845 to 1849:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Payne can be viewed as an accommodationist, he and other church leaders in the mid-nineteenth century faced the enormous task of providing uplift for the masses of the still enslaved and the newly freed black people, most of whom were illiterate and still hampered by the segregation of schools and the prohibition against teaching slaves.<span class="citation" data-cites="mamiya_social_1994"><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through the support of institutions like Bethel AME Church and an increase in manumission driven by changing practices of agriculture in Maryland, Baltimore’s free black community grew quickly from the early nineteenth century through the 1840s. Unfortunately, in the 1850s and early 1860s, white Marylanders, both slaveholders and their supporters, reacted to the growing free black population in the state by subjecting free and enslaved black workers to violent attacks and new forms of oppression. New state laws, both proposed and enacted, threatened free black men, women, and children with reenslavement. Local abolitionists and activists like William Watkins and George Hackett, among many others, worked in opposition but the growth of the city’s free black population slowed dramatically in the 1850s. Christopher Phillips summarizes this transition noting that Baltimore changed from “a place of refuge to one of repression”.<span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_negroes_1992"><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Circumstances changed again for free black Baltimoreans in the 1860s. The start of the Civil War in 1861, the opportunity for free and enslaved black Marylanders to enlist in the U.S. Colored Troops in 1863, the emancipation of enslaved Marylanders under a new state constitution in 1864, the decision <em>In Re Turner</em> (1867) to overturn Maryland’s regressive “apprenticeship” law, and the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1870, led to a dramatic expansion of Civil Rights and opportunity for black people in Baltimore.</p>
<p>By 1870, 330,741 African Americans lived in Baltimore City and County.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Black men could vote and black children could attend segregated public schools. Aspiring black teachers could enroll for training at the Baltimore Normal School (established 1865) or the Centenary Biblical Institute (established 1867).<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout this period, local efforts were not isolated to Baltimore but often connected to efforts across the state and nation through networks of people working within abolitionist organizations, black churches, fraternal groups, and the Colored Conventions movement. The <a href="http://coloredconventions.org/">Colored Conventions Project</a> summarizes the importance of this period, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The convention movement took place during critical decades which witnessed devastating race riots and the growing popularity of the American Colonization Society; the Fugitive Slave Law and the proliferation of derogatory representations of Blacks; the Civil War and Reconstruction; and the rise of repeated Black disenfranchisement in legal, labor and educational spheres in the late nineteenth century. Speakers at conventions responded to these issues by calling for community-based action that gathered funds, established schools and literary societies, and urged the necessity of hard work in what would become a decades-long campaign for civil and human rights.<span class="citation" data-cites="foreman_colored_2016"><a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within Baltimore City, few of the buildings associated with this early period of community building, self-help, and nascent Civil Rights activism survived through the present. The blocks around Courtland Street and Hamilton Street once housed some of Baltimore’s most prominent black families, along with the Second Colored Baptist Church, Union Baptist Church, Bethel AME Church, the Baltimore Normal School, and the Maryland Home for Friendless Colored Children. Between the early 1900s and 1930s, nearly all of these buildings fell to demolition: first from a street widening program that followed the 1904 fire, then the construction of Preston Gardens in the late 1910s, and, finally, the construction of the Orleans Street Viaduct in the in 1935.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In south and southwest Baltimore, many homes and buildings from Baltimore’s early black history survived through mid-twentieth century but were torn down for the University of Maryland Urban Renewal Area, the Camden Yards Industrial Park, the Baltimore Convention Center, and the construction of I-395/I-95. Some landmarks do survive, such as Ebenzer AME Church (erected in 1865), Orchard Street United Methodist Church (built in 1837 with substantial alterations in 1859 and 1882 ), the John Wesley Chapel on Hughes Street, and pre-Civil War rowhouses within the Sharp Leadenhall.</p>
<p>Four key themes are clear in this early period of Civil Rights history in Baltimore. Individuals and organized groups worked together to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#promote-the-abolition-of-enslaved-black-people">Promote the abolition of enslaved black people</a></li>
<li><a href="#protect-the-rights-of-free-black-people">Protect the rights of free black people</a></li>
<li><a href="#establish-schools-for-black-people-in-Baltimore">Establish schools for black people in Baltimore</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding why these actions took place and the role of factors outside of Baltimore, requires a discussion of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black population growth in Baltimore</li>
<li>Organization of black churches and fraternal organizations</li>
<li>Changing conext of European immigrant and economic of before the Civil War</li>
<li>Federal support for black people in Baltimore during and after the Civil War</li>
</ul>
<!-- FIXME: This is a formative period but I need to explain how. This is too generic: "The issues and approaches developed at this time continued to drive Baltimore’s African American Civil Rights movement through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries." -->
<h2 id="promote-the-abolition-of-enslaved-black-people">Promote the abolition of enslaved black people</h2>
<p>Slavery in Maryland began to change early in the nineteenth century. More and more farms stopped cultivating tobacco with enslaved labor and shifted to growing grain and produce, less labor-intensive crops that relied more on the labor of European immigrants. This change led to a significant increase in the number of voluntary manumissions in Maryland and a shift towards “term” slavery where slaveholders promised to manumit the people they held after a set period of years.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<!-- TODO: Improve this summary of slaveholding in Maryland/Baltimore. -->
<p>Around this same time, religious groups in the state began to advocate against slavery—especially Quakers or the Society of Friends. Methodism also had an early association with abolitionism. One of the first major white religious voices against slavery, Methodist leader Francis Ashbury presented an anti-slavery petition from Methodist bishops to George Washington.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> This led enslaved and free African Americans to associate with the Methodist Church, seen in the organization of Sharp Street Church in 1787.</p>
<p>Accordingly Methodist Churches and Quaker meeting houses within Baltimore, and in the larger region, played a critical role in promoting abolitionist sentiment and in providing support for enslaved people to escape on the “Underground Railroad”.</p>
<p>Communities of free blacks were also important to the Underground Railroad, such as the free black community that built the Howard Methodist Episcopal Church in Port Deposit, Maryland in 1853 (a building later demolished in 1981). Examples of pre-Civil War free black communities in Baltimore County include Glen Arm around the Waugh Church where services began as early as 1829 (the first chapel constructed in 1849); the community around the Piney Grove Church built in 1850; and the Troyer Road community formed around the Mount Joy African Methodist Episcopal Church and the Union United Methodist Chapel (both built between 1850 and 1877).<span class="citation" data-cites="eht_traceries_african_2016"><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Supportive abolitionists, however, remained a distinct minority in a state where most white residents and the government itself supported slavery. William Still observed the challenges facing enslaved black people attempting escape through Baltimore in his 1872 history <em>The Underground Railroad</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Baltimore used to be in the days of Slavery one of the most difficult places in the South for even free colored people to get away from, much more slaves. The rule forbade any colored person leaving there by rail road or steamboat, without such applicant had been weighed, measured, and then given a bond signed by unquestionable signatures well known. Baltimore was rigid in the extreme, and was a never-failing source of annoyance, trouble and expense to colored people generally, and not unfrequently to slave-holders too, when they were traveling North with ‘colored servants’ … But, not withstanding all this weighing, measuring and requiring of bonds, many travelers by the Underground Rail Road took passage from Baltimore.<span class="citation" data-cites="still_underground_1872"><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many ways, Baltimore City became a hub for fugitives headed toward the Susquehanna River and Wilmington, Delaware (where abolitionists like Thomas Garrett waited to assist) or escaping north through Baltimore County.<span class="citation" data-cites="maryland_state_archives_flight_2010"><a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Railroads were one part of the infrastructure for escape. The Pratt and Charles Street Depot for the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad and, after 1850, President Street Station at 601 President Street saw a number of notable fugitives pass through on their escape north including Henry “Box” Brown (who escaped from Virginia in 1849), William and Ellen Craft (who escaped from Georgia in 1848), and, most famously, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a> in 1838.<span class="citation" data-cites="maryland_public_television_pathways_2002"><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></span> Born into slavery around February 1818, Frederick Douglass first arrived in Baltimore around 1828. On September 3, 1838, Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery in Baltimore, traveling by train to New York City, and soon moving again to New Bedford, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>White and black abolitionists experienced significant resistance in Maryland which only grew from the 1830s through the 1850s. In the early 1830s, Baltimore’s free people of color and enslaved people alike faced the growing hostility many of Baltimore’s white residents. Following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner&#39;s_slave_rebellion">Nat Turner’s slave rebellion</a> in Southampton, Virginia, on August 21, 1831, slaveholders in Maryland panicked over rumors of impending revolts in Maryland. Historian Sarah Katz noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reports in well respected papers like Niles’ Weekly Register and the Baltimore American lent credibility to such rumors, thereby adding to the hysteria. Although the papers contradicted themselves with each issue, they reflected the frenzied fear among whites that the nation’s slaves were prepared to rise up in a violent bid for freedom.<span class="citation" data-cites="katz_rumors_1994"><a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Katz continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exaggerated reports of slave revolt alarmed Baltimore in 1831; so did a fear of abolition societies. Many supporters of slavery thought the antislavery movement encouraged insurrection. … Some Baltimoreans went so far as to accuse abolitionist societies of holding midnight military drills to prepare blacks for insurrection.<span class="citation" data-cites="katz_rumors_1994"><a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In response to these fears, the Maryland State Legislature placed new restrictions on enslaved and free black people in Maryland and with the goal to encourage free blacks to move out of state. In 1832, the Maryland state legislature moved to prohibit free blacks from entering the state, banned free black Marylanders from owning firearms without a certificate from county officials and outlawed the sale of alcohol, powder, and shot to blacks. Under the new policies, African Americans could longer hold religious meetings unless a white minister is present. The legislature excepted congregations in Baltimore City from the new law.</p>
<p>The penalties for anyone caught assisting enslaved people in escape were severe. In early 1842, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Turner_Torrey">Charles Turner Torrey</a> organized an Underground Railroad route from Washington to Baltimore, Philadelphia and Albany. Torrey moved to Baltimore in late 1843 and, in June 1844, was arrested and confined to the Maryland Penitentiary. Torrey died in prison from tuberculosis on May 9, 1846 but the story of his life and death inspired action from abolitionists throughout the United States and Europe.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>The Baltimore Jail was also an important site for the detention of escaped slaves and abolitionists. A new Baltimore Jail was designed by local architects James and Thomas Dixon, and completed in 1859. Up until 1864, the jail held hundreds of “runaways” along with Marylanders, both white and black, who assisted enslaved people as they fled to freedom. The Warden’s House from the original jail complex still stands on East Madison Street though the remainder of the complex was largely demolished in the 1960s. Before the Civil War, a number of private slave jails operated around the Baltimore Harbor but none of those buildings have survived through the present.<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The passage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850">Fugitive Slave Act of 1850</a>, pushed by Southern slaveholders to stem the flow of enslaved people moving north to freedom, led to expanded efforts by abolitionists to support the Underground Railroad and growing violence on both sides. One notable early challenge to the Fugitive Slave Act came in 1851 is the Christiana Riot (also known as the Christiana Resistance), where Baltimore County slaveholder Edward Gorsuch and several others were wounded seeking to recapture four enslaved men who had escaped to the farm of abolitionist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Parker_(abolitionist)">William Parker</a> in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.<span class="citation" data-cites="kuhn_maryland_2015"><a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Baltimore and Maryland slaveholders called on the Baltimore police and local police and courts in northern states to support their efforts to recapture escaped enslaved people.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Ultimately, abolitionist activity changed dramatically for a final time during the Civil War. Following the 1863 emancipation proclamation George Hackett, a free African American and member of Bethel AME Church, would frequently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…hire a wagon, go on a plantation, fill it with slaves, and with a six-barrelled revolver in each hand, defy the master the master to prevent it.<span class="citation" data-cites="mamiya_social_1994"><a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next year, a new state Constitution abolished slavery in Maryland and most former abolitionists shifted their efforts to focus on the support of newly emancipated black Marylanders, especially around the issue of education (addressed in a later section of this report).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This section may require some additional elaboration explaining how abolition fits within a context for Civil Rights and the relationship between the two. I felt like it would be inappropriate to exclude it from this report but a less detailed overview may be appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="protect-the-rights-of-free-black-people">Protect the rights of free black people</h2>
<p>Free black people in Baltimore resisted oppression in a variety of ways before and during the Civil War. Their efforts established a foundation for the rise of the more formal Civil Rights movement in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
<p>Although the Colonization movement was one of the most visible of the strategies used by Maryland slaveholders to try to remove free black people from the state, white opposition to black freedom took a variety of forms including reenslavement through everything from contract disputes to outright kidnapping and, following the Civil War, an attempt to replace enslavement with a apprenticeship system that functioned as de facto enslavement.</p>
<p>Much of the response to Nat Turner’s Rebellion in 1831 was directed not just as enslaved people or abolitionists but at free black residents across the state. Other examples of slave rebellions in this period include an attempted rebellion in 1840 described by Solomon Northrup:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In October a large number of slaves on a plantation in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, rebelled. The rebellion appears to have been spontaneous. The overseer was seriously wounded and the slaves resisted the local police. All the rebels were captured except one, and one slave was shot. What happened to them is not known.<span class="citation" data-cites="northup_twelve_1895"><a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Historian Jeffery Brackett cites another example from Charles County in 1845:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Charles County, Maryland there was an insurrection of slaves and free Blacks. One slave was hanged, several others sold out of the State, and the free Blacks were given 40 years in prison.<span class="citation" data-cites="brackett_negro_1889"><a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></span></p>

<p>The Colonization movement in Maryland first organized on a statewide level in 1827 when a group of loosely organized regional and county societies united to form the first state group. The project received an annual grant of $1,000 from the Maryland General Assembly to transport free blacks Marylanders to the American Colonization Society’s settlement in Liberia. When the group sent only twelve emigrants to Liberia in 1828, the state soon terminated its appropriation the following year. Support for colonization was renewed following Nat Turner’s Rebellion in August 1831 leading the state to reinstated an appropriation of $10,000 a year for twenty years settle free black Marylanders in Liberia.<span class="citation" data-cites="msa_maryland_2012"><a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In <em>Freedom’s Port: The African American Community of Baltimore, 1790-1860</em>, historian Christopher Phillips recounts African American resistance to the efforts by the Maryland Colonization Society to encourage free blacks to migrate from Maryland to Liberia, noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pervasively hostile sentiment against colonization throughout the period and the equally persuasive demeanor of the Baltimore junto forced the Maryland Colonization Society to abandon recruitment effort on the state’s Western Shore. Of the emigrants sponsored by the Maryland State Colonization Society between 1832 and 1841, only fifty (less than 8 percent) were from Baltimore.<span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_freedoms_1997"><a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an effort to remove manumitted slaves from Maryland, black activism helped to ensure the failure of the Colonization movement. In a twenty year period, from 1831 to 1851, only 1,025 emigrants were sent to Liberia while the number of recorded manumissions during the same period was 5,571. The latter figure likely understates the total number of enslaved people freed in that period as all slave owners filed manumissions.<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Not all black Baltimoreans opposed colonization. Most famously, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coker">Daniel Coker</a>, the founding pastor of Bethel AME Church, emigrated to Liberia in 1820. But, as Phillips writes, the “conflict over colonization offered black Baltimoreans the opportunity to further the evolution of their own community as distinct and autonomous.” Phillips continued to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether for or against colonization, Baltimore’s black community unified around a principle far more compelling; racial progress. Baltimore’s black society became, in the words of one historian of urban African Americans of the antebellum North, a “community of commitment.”<span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_freedoms_1997"><a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even the representatives of the Maryland Colonization Society ultimately understood this idea. In 1838, the group’s traveling agent John H. Kennard reported to the board of managers summarizing his understanding of black opposition to Colonization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They are taught to believe, and, do believe, that this is their country, their home. A Country and home, now wickedly withholden from them but which they will presently possess, own and control. Those who Emigrate to Liberia, are held up to the world, as the vilest and veriest traitors to their race, and especially so, towards their brethren in bonds. Every man woman and child who leaves this country for Africa is considered one taken from the strength of the colored population and by his departure, as protracting the time when the black man will by the strength of his own arm compell those who despise and oppress him, to acknowledge his rights, redress his wrongs, and restore the wages, long due and inniquitously withholden.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Maryland State Colonization Society ended active operations in 1863 shortly after the beginning of the Civil War. The membership and leadership of the Maryland Colonization Society included some of the state’s most prominent residents. It seems likely that a number of residences associated with those individuals are still extant in the greater Baltimore region. Advocacy against colonization took place primarily in black churches, such as Sharp Street and Bethel AME Church, but likely also in the homes of free black opponents of Colonization.</p>

<p>John Brown’s October raid on Harper’s Ferry in October 1859, inspired new efforts such as the Jacobs bill, named for sponsor Colonel C.W. Jacobs, member of Maryland’s House of Delegates from the Eastern Shore, to reenslave or expel free black residents of Maryland. While the Jacobs Bill was ultimately defeated, it reflects the deep challenges facing African American Baltimoreans in this period.<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Some proposals met resistance, especially from members of the Society of Friends who held a religious opposition to slavery. For example, in March 1842, a public meeting was held at the Exeter Street Church, chaired by Richard Frisby, Esq. in response to a proposed bill before the Maryland Senate, “An act for the better security of negro slaves in this State, and for promoting industry and honesty among the free people of color”. The meeting supported a resolution that the proposed bill “is well calculated, on account of its obnoxious and oppressive provisions, to produce among our citizens painful agitations, both political and religious, which may endanger the prosperity and peace of the State.<span class="citation" data-cites="sun_meeting_1842"><a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></span></p>

<p>In 1859, following John Brown’s October raid on Harper’s Ferry, Colonel C.W. Jacobs, member of Maryland’s House of Delegates from the Eastern Shore, introduced a bill to reenslave or expel free black residents of Maryland. African American opposition to the Jacobs Bill was led by George Hackett. George Hackett’s father, Charles Hackett, was one of the founding trustees of Bethel in 1815. George Hackett spent ten years working as a seaman before he became an independent business owner — first operating a livery stable and later a coal yard.<span class="citation" data-cites="mamiya_social_1994"><a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></span> Hackett also organized the “Protection Association”, what historian Lawrence H.

<p>George Hackett helping to circulate petitions, holding weekly meetings, mostly at Bethel Church, then located on Saratoga Street near Gay Street, to “formulate their position”. On February 9, 1860, at 3:00 am in the morning, the black opponents of the Jacobs bill gathered at Bethel for an “indignation service”. Lawrence H. Mamiya writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indignation services, as they were called, originated with the Bethel congregation in the mid-nineteenth century to mobilize the black community and publicly express its views on serious black offenses.<span class="citation" data-cites="mamiya_social_1994"><a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>African American opponents helped to defeat the bill but were joined in opposition by pro-slavery Democrats who saw the proposal as a threat to the system of “quasi-freedom” where the ready mix of free and enslaved labor provided significant advantages to slaveholders. Historian Frank Towers quotes editor Frank Key Howard, writing in the <em>Daily Exchange</em> on March 7, 1860, stated that if the Jacobs’ bill became law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…not only will a class pour into take the place vacated by the negroes, who hate and are jealous of slaveholders, but a revulsion will be produced in the sentiments of thousands…<span class="citation" data-cites="towers_job_2000"><a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></span></p>

In a similar attempt, a petition to bar free Negroes from any mechanical branch of trade did not result in any legislative action. Another unsuccessful organized attempt to oust Negroes from their employment took place in 1859 as the “Stavegut Society” sought work on the city railroads, but for no less than $1.25 a day, while Negroes had been working for $1.00.<span class="citation" data-cites="della_jr._problems_1972"><a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Labor riots continued into 1859 as a group of Negroes putting copper on the bottom of a boat at Fells Point on June 28 were attacked and beaten by whites when they refused to stop work.

<p>In 1865, white caulkers went on strike to exclude black caulkers from the shipyards. In response, George Hackett, Isaac Myers, William F. Taylor, John W.

<!-- FIXME: It is important to note the interracial character of organizing on this theme. -->
<p>Expanding educational opportunities for black Baltimoreans and employment opportunities for black educators was a key goal in the broader efforts of “racial progress” articulated by the movement opposing colonization.</p>
<p>In 1797, the Maryland Society for the Abolition of Slavery, a Quaker abolitionist group, opened the Baltimore African Academy for the children of free black parents—the first schools for African Americans in Baltimore. In 1826, the General Assembly of Maryland authorized the creation of the Baltimore City school system for white children under the age of ten and the first school, known as Public School No. 1, opened on September 21, 1829. Public Schools No. 2 and 3 opened soon after and by the end of the year, enrolled 269 students. African Americans recognized the injustice of being forced to pay school taxes that supported only white schools, Africans American leaders in Baltimore petitioned the city government to provide either tax relief or schools for black children in 1839, 1844, and 1850. In each case, the Mayor and City Council rejected the petitions, despite the 1850 petition having signatures from 90 black and 126 white Baltimore residents.<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_brown_2011"><a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></span></p>

At their peak in 1867, the group had set up more than 100 schools in Baltimore and on the Eastern Shore.<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_brown_2011"><a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 id="changing-population">Changing population</h3>
<p>Even in 1831, the growing size of Baltimore’s free black population marked a significant change in patterns of slave-holding in Baltimore and Maryland at the beginning of the 19th century. Between 1800 and 1860, the proportion of Baltimore city residents who held slaves declined, the share of Baltimore’s total population held in slavery declined and the share of the black population living in freedom grew.</p>
<!-- TODO: Insert table based on data from Phillips. -->
<p>Nearly one-third of city residents held at least one enslaved person in 1800. In 1850, slaveholders made up just over one-percent of the city’s white population. Enslaved people made up 9% of the city’s population in 1790, just under 2% in 1850, and barely 1% in 1860. A small minority of the city’s African Americans, just 20%, were free in 1790. By 1830, over 75% of the same population was free and over 90% in 1860.<span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_freedoms_1997"><a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></span></p>

<li>Bethel AME Church (c. 1817, nonextant)</li>

<li>Ebenezer AME Church (1865, extant)</li>
</ul>
<!-- QUESTION: How did these churches fit into a growing national network of black religious groups? -->
<p>Historian J. Gordon Melton observed the frustrations that black church experienced in this period as they sought to secure independent black leadership:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through the 1820s, both Sharp Street and Asbury remained as the African churches attached to the one Baltimore charge. Then in 1830, one of the three Baltimore ministers, Joseph Frey, was given the specific charge of serving the two Black congregations. Two years later, the two churches were set aside as the “African Methodist Episcopal Church in the City of Baltimore” and incorporated as a single entity. The members of Sharp Street reacted to these events by annually petitioning the Baltimore conference to assign a Black preacher as the minister in charge. Their petition was annually tabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Eventually, in reaction to the failure of their annual petitions, beginning in 1848 (at the first MEC general conference after the Southern conferences had departed), Black Methodists from Sharp Street and other Black congregations began to lobby for the organization of an all-Black Conference to include the churches in the care of the Baltimore Conference.<span class="citation" data-cites="melton_african_2005"><a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Civil War led to changes in the organization of the church:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus it was that the 1864 General Conference accepted petitions to organize the African American congregations into Annual conferences (albeit segregated ones). Beginning 1864 with the Delaware and Washington Conferences, The MEC organized a set of conferences for Black members across the nation.<span class="citation" data-cites="melton_african_2005"><a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other social organizations beyond churches also played an important role in this period. For example, George Hackett was involved with founding the Douglass Institute (1865) and the Gregory Aged Women’s Home (1867). Ann Prout member and Sunday school teacher at Bethel became president of the association in charge of the home.<span class="citation" data-cites="mamiya_social_1994"><a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></span></p>

<p>In April 1861, after months of pressure from members of the state legislature, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Holliday_Hicks">Governor Hicks</a> convened a special session of the assembly to consider a “course of action”—but lawmakers ultimately declined to consider secession ending the discussion for good. Other proposals for Maryland to stay “neutral” in the fight went nowhere.</p>
<p>According to the Maryland Historical Society <a href="https://www.mdhs.org/sites/default/files/Civil_War.pdf">Guide to Civil War Sources</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is estimated that up to 60,000 Marylanders fought for the Union during the Civil War. Maryland raised 20 infantry and four cavalry regiments for Union service, along with six artillery batteries. There were no official Maryland troops in the Confederacy, but sympathetic Marylanders organized infantry, cavalry, and artillery units. Others joined military outfits from other states. As many as 25,000 Marylanders fought for the South in the war. On the whole, those officers who fought for the Confederacy tended to represent the landed gentry of Maryland, while Union officers were more likely to be farmers or artisans. Those Marylanders fighting for the Confederacy suffered greater combat losses than those who sided with the North.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A variety of forces began to challenge slavery early in the war. In April 1862, the emancipation of enslaved people in Washington, DC created new opportunities for enslaved blacks to escape from bondage. In 1863, the federal government began recruiting for the new U.S. Colored Troops, enlisting over 8,700 black men in six Maryland regiments.</p>
<!-- TODO: Research Baltimore's 30th and 31st Colored Regiments. -->
<p>In 1864, Maryland passed a new state constitution abolishing slavery and disenfranchised Marylanders who had left the state to fight for or live in the Confederacy and those who supported the Confederacy within the state. Under this arrangement the Maryland legislature approved the the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery throughout the nation on February 3, 1865. However, with the restoration of voting rights for many Confederate sympathizers or veterans following the end of the Civil War, the Maryland State Legislature specifically rejected the Fourteenth Amendment (guaranteeing the rights of citizens and other persons) on March 23, 1867. Three years later, the state rejected the Fifteenth Amendment on February 26, 1870.
