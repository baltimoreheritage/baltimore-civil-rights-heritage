<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In 1831, over 17,888 free people of color and 10,653 enslaved African Americans called Baltimore home.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Free black men and women living in Maryland could not vote and could not testify in any criminal trial. These men and women paid taxes but their children could not attend Baltimore’s new public schools. White employers excluded black workers from all but the most difficult and dangerous jobs in the city’s growing industrial economy.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Baltimore was also a refuge. The city’s growing free black community in the 1830s and 1840s worked to build churches and social institutions that improved the lives of Baltimore’s black residents through education and mutual assistance. While some observers may not see “self-help” as Civil Rights activism, such efforts provided critical support to Baltimore’s black residents at the time, as historian Lawrence H. Mamiya observes when reflecting on the legacy of pastor Rev. Daniel Payne, pastor of Bethel AME Church from 1845 to 1849:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Payne can be viewed as an accommodationist, he and other church leaders in the mid-nineteenth century faced the enormous task of providing uplift for the masses of the still enslaved and the newly freed black people, most of whom were illiterate and still hampered by the segregation of schools and the prohibition against teaching slaves.<span class="citation" data-cites="mamiya_social_1994"><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 1850s and early 1860s, however, white Marylanders, both slaveholders and their supporters, reacted to the growing free black population in the state by subjecting black workers to violent attacks, threatening reenslavement for free black residents,</p>
<p>By 1870, 330,741 African Americans lived in Baltimore City and County. Black men could vote and black children could attend segregated public schools. Aspiring black teachers could enroll for training at the Baltimore Normal School (established 1865) or the Centenary Biblical Institute (established 1867).<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In the decades before the U.S. Civil War, Baltimore’s free black community grew but also struggled against rising white violence against African Americans.</p>
<p>a combination of local organizing and the national challenges to slavery that led to the Civil War transformed the lives of Baltimore’s African American residents.</p>
<!-- FIXME: This is a formative period but I need to explain how. This is too generic: "The issues and approaches developed at this time continued to drive Baltimore’s African American Civil Rights movement through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries." -->
<h2 id="how-did-civil-rights-in-baltimore-change-between-1831-and-1870">How did Civil Rights in Baltimore change between 1831 and 1870?</h2>
<p>In the early 1830s, Baltimore’s free people of color and enslaved people alike faced growing hostility many of Baltimore’s white residents. Following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner&#39;s_slave_rebellion">Nat Turner’s slave rebellion</a> in Southampton, Virginia, on August 21, 1831, slaveholders in Maryland panicked over rumors of impending revolts in Maryland. Historian Sarah Katz noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reports in well respected papers like Niles’ Weekly Register and the Baltimore American lent credibility to such rumors, thereby adding to the hysteria. Although the papers contradicted themselves with each issue, they reflected the frenzied fear among whites that the nation’s slaves were prepared to rise up in a violent bid for freedom.<span class="citation" data-cites="katz_rumors_1994"><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Katz continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exaggerated reports of slave revolt alarmed Baltimore in 1831; so did a fear of abolition societies. Many supporters of slavery thought the antislavery movement encouraged insurrection. … Some Baltimoreans went so far as to accuse abolitionist societies of holding midnight military drills to prepare blacks for insurrection.<span class="citation" data-cites="katz_rumors_1994"><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In response to these fears, the Maryland State Legislature placed new restrictions on enslaved and free black people in Maryland and with the goal to encourage free blacks to move out of state. In 1832, the Maryland state legislature moved to prohibit free blacks from entering the state, banned free black Marylanders from owning firearms without a certificate from county officials and outlawed the sale of alcohol, powder, and shot to blacks. Under the new policies, African Americans could longer hold religious meetings unless a white minister is present. The legislature excepted congregations in Baltimore City from the new law.</p>
<!-- TODO: Add a list of major black congregations around 1832 including locations. -->
<!-- TODO: Find references on Maryland's response to the Nat Turner Rebellion. Found the Katz article cited above. May need more. -->
<p>Efforts to impose new restrictions continued on the federal level with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850">Fugitive Slave Act of 1850</a> and additional restrictions on free blacks approved in 1854. John Brown’s October raid on Harper’s Ferry in October 1859, inspired new efforts such as the Jacobs bill, named for sponsor Colonel C.W. Jacobs, member of Maryland’s House of Delegates from the Eastern Shore, to reenslave or expel free black residents of Maryland. While the Jacobs Bill was ultimately defeated, it reflects the deep challenges facing African American Baltimoreans in this period.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Christopher Phillips summarizes this transition by observing how Baltimore changed from “a place of refuge to one of repression.”<span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_negroes_1992"><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> Free black people in Baltimore resisted oppression in a variety of ways that helped to build a foundation for the rise of the more formal Civil Rights movement in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Payne can be viewed as an accommodationist, he and other church leaders in the mid-nineteenth century faced the enormous task of providing uplift for the masses of the still enslaved and the newly freed black people, most of whom were illiterate and still hampered by the segregation of schools and the prohibition against teaching slaves.<span class="citation" data-cites="mamiya_social_1994"><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phillips similarly notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather than overt organized opposition, Baltimore’s free blacks sought to strengthen their social institutions, by which to provide by example—both to themselves and to whites—that they were worthy of equal treatment.<span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_negroes_1992"><a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In response to these challenges and others, African Americans in Baltimore, sometimes joined by white allies, worked together to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote abolition and emancipation of enslaved African Americans</li>
<li>Resist the Colonization movement in Maryland</li>
<li>Protect the limited rights of free black people</li>
<li>Organize schools for black Baltimoreans</li>
</ul>
<p>Several local factors shaped this changing context for Civil Rights within this period, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baltimore’s growing free back population before and after the Civil War</li>
<li>The growing strength of black churches and fraternal organizations</li>
<li>Local and national economic challenges before the Civil War</li>
<li>Federal support for black rights during and after the Civil War</li>
</ul>

<!-- TODO: Insert a short summary of slaveholding in Baltimore. -->
<ul>
<li>Mention early abolitionists</li>
<li>Mention connection to Quakers</li>
<li>Mention connection to Methodism</li>
</ul>
<p>Baltimore’s significant place in the broader debate around abolition and emancipation is vividly illustrated through the experiences of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>. Born into slavery around February 1818, Frederick Douglass first arrived in Baltimore around 1828. On September 3, 1838, Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery in Baltimore, traveling by train to New York City, and soon moving again to New Bedford, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Not everyone who attempted to seek their freedom in the north succeeded. Abolitionists and people who assisted enslaved people in escaping from bondage faced significant risks. In early 1842, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Turner_Torrey">Charles Turner Torrey</a> organized an Underground Railroad route from Washington to Baltimore, Philadelphia and Albany. Torrey moved to Baltimore in late 1843 and, in June 1844, was arrested and confined to the Maryland Penitentiary. Torrey died in prison from tuberculosis on May 9, 1846 but the story of his life and death (published in 1847 as the <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/memoirofrevcharl00love2">Memoir of Rev. Charles T. Torrey who died in the penitentiary of Maryland, where he was confined for showing mercy to the poor</a></em>) inspired action from abolitionists throughout the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>Another example of a site associated with this history of detaining abolitionists and their supporters is the Baltimore Jail, designed by local architects James and Thomas Dixon, and completed in 1859. Up until 1864, the jail held hundreds of “runaways” along with Marylanders, both white and black, who assisted enslaved people as they fled to freedom. The Warden’s House from the original jail complex still stands on East Madison Street though the remainder of the complex was largely demolished in the 1960s. Before the Civil War, a number of private slave jails operated around the Baltimore Harbor but none of those buildings have survived through the present.</p>
<!-- TODO: Add citation from research on slavery and the jail. -->
<p>The passage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850">Fugitive Slave Act of 1850</a>, pushed by Southern slaveholders to stem the flow of enslaved people moving north to freedom, led to expanded efforts by abolitionists to support the Underground Railroad and growing violence on both sides. One notable early challenge to the Fugitive Slave Act came in 1851 is the Christiana Riot (also known as the Christiana Resistance), where Baltimore County slaveholder Edward Gorsuch and several others were wounded seeking to recapture four enslaved men who had escaped to the farm of abolitionist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Parker_(abolitionist)">William Parker</a> in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.<span class="citation" data-cites="kuhn_maryland_2015"><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dred Scott Decision in 1857 <em>The Sun</em> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“we cannot… refrain from expressing our gratification that this important subject has at last had a final adjudication, and one which is in accordance with the great principle of popular sovereignty.”<span class="citation" data-cites="kuhn_maryland_2015"><a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- QUESTION: How many people fled from slavery in Maryland before the Civil War? How many people fled through Baltimore or took shelter in Baltimore? -->
<p>George Hackett supported the underground railroad, especially after the 1863 emancipation proclamation, and would frequently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“hire a wagon, go on a plantation, fill it with slaves, and with a six-barrelled revolver in each hand, defy the master the master to prevent it.”<span class="citation" data-cites="mamiya_social_1994"><a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>

<p>Sources.</p>
<p>In <em>Freedom’s Port: The African American Community of Baltimore, 1790-1860</em>, historian Christopher Phillips recounts African American resistance to the efforts by the Maryland Colonization Society to encourage free blacks to migrate from Maryland to Liberia, noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pervasively hostile sentiment against colonization throughout the period and the equally persuasive demeanor of the Baltimore junto forced the Maryland Colonization Society to abandon recruitment effort on the state’s Western Shore. Of the emigrants sponsored by the Maryland State Colonization Society between 1832 and 1841, only fifty (less than 8 percent) were from Baltimore.<span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_freedoms_1997"><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not all black Baltimoreans opposed colonization (most famously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coker">Daniel Coker</a>—founding pastor of Bethel AME Church who emigrated to Liberia in 1820) but, as Phillips writes, the “conflict over colonization offered black Baltimoreans the opportunity to further the evolution of their own community as distinct and autonomous.” Phillips continued to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether for or against colonization, Baltimore’s black community unified around a principle far more compelling; racial progress. Baltimore’s black society became, in the words of one historian of urban African Americans of the antebellum North, a “community of commitment.”<span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_freedoms_1997"><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="protect-free-black-people-from-reenslavement">Protect free black people from reenslavement</h3>
<p>Although Colonization was one of the most visible of the strategies used by Maryland slaveholders to try to remove free black people from the state, there were a variety of approaches used to restrict the freedoms of “free” people and including reenslavement through contract disputes, criminal proceedings, and outright kidnapping.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="berlin_slaves_2007"><a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></span>,<span class="citation" data-cites="fields_slavery_1985"><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></span><span class="citation" data-cites="evitts_matter_1974"><a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span><span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_freedoms_1997"><a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Some proposals met resistance, especially from members of the Society of Friends who held a religious opposition to slavery. For example, in March 1842, a public meeting was held at the Exeter Street Church, chaired by Richard Frisby, Esq. in response to a proposed bill before the Maryland Senate, “An act for the better security of negro slaves in this State, and for promoting industry and honesty among the free people of color”. The meeting supported a resolution that the proposed bill “is well calculated, on account of its obnoxious and oppressive provisions, to produce among our citizens painful agitations, both political and religious, which may endanger the prosperity and peace of the State.<span class="citation" data-cites="sun_meeting_1842"><a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In 1854, the Maryland legislature passed a law requiring blacks who broke labor contracts to work without pay for their employers.<span class="citation" data-cites="towers_job_2000"><a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Della on attacks on black workers:</p>

<p>Labor riots continued into 1859 as a group of Negroes putting copper on the bottom of a boat at Fells Point on June 28 were attacked and beaten by whites when they refused to stop work.

<p>In 1859, following John Brown’s October raid on Harper’s Ferry, Colonel C.W. Jacobs, member of Maryland’s House of Delegates from the Eastern Shore, introduced a bill to reenslave or expel free black residents of Maryland. African American opposition to the Jacobs Bill was led by George Hackett. George Hackett’s father, Charles Hackett, was one of the founding trustees of Bethel in 1815. George Hackett spent ten years working as a seaman before he became an independent business owner — first operating a livery stable and later a coal yard.<span class="citation" data-cites="mamiya_social_1994"><a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></span> Hackett also organized the “Protection Association”, what historian Lawrence H. Mamiya describes as a “a group formed to protect free blacks from enslavement”.<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>George Hackett helping to circulate petitions, holding weekly meetings, mostly at Bethel Church, then located on Saratoga Street near Gay Street, to “formulate their position”. On February 9, 1860, at 3:00 am in the morning, the black opponents of the Jacobs bill gathered at Bethel for an “indignation service”. Lawrence H. Mamiya writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Indignation services, as they were called, originated with the Bethel congregation in the mid-nineteenth century to mobilize the black community and publicly express its views on serious black offenses.”<span class="citation" data-cites="mamiya_social_1994"><a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>African American opponents helped to defeat the bill but were joined in opposition by pro-slavery Democrats who saw the proposal as a threat to the system of “quasi-freedom” where the ready mix of free and enslaved labor provided significant advantages to slaveholders. Historian Frank Towers quotes editor Frank Key Howard, writing in the <em>Daily Exchange</em> on March 7, 1860 that if the Jacobs’ bill became law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…not only will a class pour into take the place vacated by the negroes, who hate and are jealous of slaveholders, but a revulsion will be produced in the sentiments of thousands…”<span class="citation" data-cites="towers_job_2000"><a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hackett elected president of the Moral Mental Improvement Society, “met at the church on the first Sunday of each month; it was considered one of the city’s leading literary and debating societies. Most of the members of the debating societies were male, but occasionally women presented essays.”</p>
<p>In 1865, white caulkers went on strike to exclude black caulkers from the shipyards. In response, George Hackett, Isaac Myers, William F. Taylor, John W. Locks, Causemen Gaines, all laymen at Bethel AME Church, organized the Chesapeake and Marine Railway and Drydock Company. The company lasted until 1884.</p>

<!-- FIXME: It is important to note the interracial character of organizing on this theme. -->
<p>Expanding educational opportunities for black Baltimoreans and employment opportunities for black educators was a key goal in the broader efforts of “racial progress” articulated by the movement opposing colonization.</p>
<p>In 1797, the Maryland Society for the Abolition of Slavery, a Quaker abolitionist group, opened the Baltimore African Academy for the children of free black parents—the first schools for African Americans in Baltimore. In 1826, the General Assembly of Maryland authorized the creation of the Baltimore City school system for white children under the age of ten and the first school, known as Public School No. 1, opened on September 21, 1829. Public Schools No. 2 and 3 opened soon after and by the end of the year, enrolled 269 students. African Americans recognized the injustice of being forced to pay school taxes that supported only white schools, Africans American leaders in Baltimore petitioned the city government to provide either tax relief or schools for black children in 1839, 1844, and 1850. In each case, the Mayor and City Council rejected the petitions, despite the 1850 petition having signatures from 90 black and 126 white Baltimore residents.<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_brown_2011"><a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></span></p>
<!-- FIXME: Add page numbers for the above citation. -->
<p>In 1864, a group of thirty white businessmen, lawyers and ministers (mostly Quakers) formed the Baltimore Association for the Moral and Educational Improvement of Colored People with the goal of establishing a black public school system. Within a year, the group had established seven schools in Baltimore with 3,000 students enrolled. At their peak in 1867, the group had set up more than 100 schools in Baltimore and on the Eastern Shore.<span class="citation" data-cites="baum_brown_2011"><a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></span></p>

<h3 id="changing-population">Changing population</h3>
<p>Even in 1831, the growing size of Baltimore’s free black population marked a significant change in patterns of slave-holding in Baltimore and Maryland at the beginning of the 19th century. Between 1800 and 1860, the proportion of Baltimore city residents who held slaves declined, the share of Baltimore’s total population held in slavery declined and the share of the black population living in freedom grew.</p>
<!-- TODO: Insert table based on data from Phillips. -->
<p>Nearly one-third of city residents held at least one enslaved person in 1800. In 1850, slaveholders made up just over one-percent of the city’s white population. Enslaved people made up 9% of the city’s population in 1790, just under 2% in 1850, and barely 1% in 1860. A small minority of the city’s African Americans, just 20%, were free in 1790. By 1830, over 75% of the same population was free and over 90% in 1860.<span class="citation" data-cites="phillips_freedoms_1997"><a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></span></p>

<h3 id="black-churches-and-fraternal-organizations">Black churches and fraternal organizations</h3>
<p>The city’s growing black population supported the growth of both existing black churches and the foundation of new churches and religious organizations. Churches established (or expanded) within this period include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharp Street Church (1787, nonextant)</li>
<li>Bethel AME Church (c. 1817, nonextant)</li>
<li>St. James Episcopal Church (1824, nontextant)</li>
<li>Oblate Sisters of Providence (1828, nonextant)</li>
<li>Orchard Street Church (1837, rebuilt 1859, 1882, extant)</li>
<li>Union Baptist Church (1852, nontextant)</li>
<li>Ebenezer AME Church (1865, extant)</li>
</ul>
<!-- QUESTION: How did these churches fit into a growing national network of black religious groups? -->
<p>Historian J. Gordon Melton observed the frustrations that black church experienced in this period as they sought to secure independent black leadership:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through the 1820s, both Sharp Street and Asbury remained as the African churches attached to the one Baltimore charge. Then in 1830, one of the three Baltimore ministers, Joseph Frey, was given the specific charge of serving the two Black congregations. Two years later, the two churches were set aside as the “African Methodist Episcopal Church in the City of Baltimore” and incorporated as a single entity. The members of Sharp Street reacted to these events by annually petitioning the Baltimore conference to assign a Black preacher as the minister in charge. Their petition was annually tabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Eventually, in reaction to the failure of their annual petitions, beginning in 1848 (at the first MEC general conference after the Southern conferences had departed), Black Methodists from Sharp Street and other Black congregations began to lobby for the organization of an all-Black Conference to include the churches in the care of the Baltimore Conference.<span class="citation" data-cites="melton_african_2005"><a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Civil War led to changes in the organization of the church:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus it was that the 1864 General Conference accepted petitions to organize the African American congregations into Annual conferences (albeit segregated ones). Beginning 1864 with the Delaware and Washington Conferences, The MEC organized a set of conferences for Black members across the nation.<span class="citation" data-cites="melton_african_2005"><a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></span></p>

<p>George Hackett involved with founding the Douglass Insitute (1865) and the Gregory Aged Women’s Home (1867).

<!-- TODO: Find the quote from Frederick Douglass about the difficult conditions in Baltimore during the 1840s -->
<p>Major national recessions, between 1836 and 1838, 1839 and 1843, and 1857 and 1858, led to significant tensions between white and black workers in Baltimore. For example, in May 1858, a group of white workers attacked black workers at a brickyard near Federal Hill.</p>
<p>On June 28, 1859, a group of black ship-caulkers were attacked by a gang of white workers at a shipyard in Fell’s Point.</p>
<p>Efforts to restrict black workers from specific trades:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other attempts failed; for example, in 1847, a “memorial” from a number of citizens for a law to prevent free Negroes from huckstering hay or straw was referred with- out result to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Delegates. In a similar attempt, a petition to bar free Negroes from any mechanical branch of trade did not result in any legislative action. Another unsuccessful organized attempt to oust Negroes from their employment took place in 1859 as the “Stavegut Society” sought work on the city railroads, but for no less than $1.25 a day, while Negroes had been working for $1.00.<span class="citation" data-cites="della_jr._problems_1972"><a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></span></p>

<p>The <a href="http://slaverebellion.org/index.php?page=united-states-insurrections">The Slave Rebellion Website</a> quotes Solomon Northrup’s account of an attempted rebellion in 1840:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In October a large number of slaves on a plantation in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, rebelled. The rebellion appears to have been spontaneous. The overseer was seriously wounded and the slaves resisted the local police. All the rebels were captured except one, and one slave was shot. What happened to them is not known.<span class="citation" data-cites="northup_twelve_1895"><a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://slaverebellion.org/index.php?page=united-states-insurrections">The Slave Rebellion Website</a> quotes another example from 1845 mentioned by historian Jeffery Brackett:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Charles County, Maryland there was an insurrection of slaves and free Blacks. One slave was hanged, several others sold out of the State, and the free Blacks were given 40 years in prison.<span class="citation" data-cites="brackett_negro_1889"><a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></span></p>

<p>In April 1861, after months of pressure from members of the state legislature, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Holliday_Hicks">Governor Hicks</a> convened a special session of the assembly to consider a “course of action”—but lawmakers ultimately declined to consider secession ending the discussion for good. Other proposals for Maryland to stay “neutral” in the fight went nowhere.</p>
<p>According to the Maryland Historical Society <a href="https://www.mdhs.org/sites/default/files/Civil_War.pdf">Guide to Civil War Sources</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is estimated that up to 60,000 Marylanders fought for the Union during the Civil War. Maryland raised 20 infantry and four cavalry regiments for Union service, along with six artillery batteries. There were no official Maryland troops in the Confederacy, but sympathetic Marylanders organized infantry, cavalry, and artillery units. Others joined military outfits from other states. As many as 25,000 Marylanders fought for the South in the war. On the whole, those officers who fought for the Confederacy tended to represent the landed gentry of Maryland, while Union officers were more likely to be farmers or artisans. Those Marylanders fighting for the Confederacy suffered greater combat losses than those who sided with the North.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A variety of forces began to challenge slavery early in the war. In April 1862, the emancipation of enslaved people in Washington, DC created new opportunities for enslaved blacks to escape from bondage. In 1863, the federal government began recruiting for the new U.S. Colored Troops, enlisting over 8,700 black men in six Maryland regiments.</p>
<!-- TODO: Research Baltimore's 30th and 31st Colored Regiments. -->
<p>In 1864, Maryland passed a new state constitution abolishing slavery and disenfranchised Marylanders who had left the state to fight for or live in the Confederacy and those who supported the Confederacy within the state. Under this arrangement the Maryland legislature approved the the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery throughout the nation on February 3, 1865. However, with the restoration of voting rights for many Confederate sympathizers or veterans following the end of the Civil War, the Maryland State Legislature specifically rejected the Fourteenth Amendment (guaranteeing the rights of citizens and other persons) on March 23, 1867. Three years later, the state rejected the Fifteenth Amendment on February 26, 1870. The passage of the 14th Amendment and 15th Amendment to the Constitution passage of the 14th and 15th amendments, etc.<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<li>National Convention of Colored Men meets in Washington, DC (April 9, 1866)</li>
<li>First black public schools open</li>
<li>Colored Men’s Border State Convention to the People of the United States held in Baltimore</li>
</ul>
<p>George Hackett was involved with Black Border States Convention meetings in 1860s.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://coloredconventions.org/conventions?by=year">Colored Conventions Project</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The convention movement took place during critical decades which witnessed devastating race riots and the growing popularity of the American Colonization Society; the Fugitive Slave Law and the proliferation of derogatory representations of Blacks; the Civil War and Reconstruction; and the rise of repeated Black disenfranchisement in legal, labor and educational spheres in the late nineteenth century. Speakers at conventions responded to these issues by calling for community-based action that gathered funds, established schools and literary societies, and urged the necessity of hard work in what would become a decades-long campaign for civil and human rights. The convention minutes collected here illustrate the immense struggles and the profound courage of those who made it a point to organize and stand for what was rightly theirs.</p>
