## Summary

Between 1870 and 1905, black Baltimoreans used their new legal rights to win access to local universities, secured the desegregation of city streetcars, and opposed a statewide movement disenfranchise black voters. Frustrated by efforts to organize within the Republican party, African Americans organized independent Civil Rights advocacy organizations that laid a foundation for later organizing efforts. Unfortunately, white racist reaction to these limited gains contributed to increasingly segregated housing and police violence against African Americans. These changes were driven by emerging national networks of Civil Rights activists following the Civil War, the continued growth of Baltimore's black population, and the modest gains in wealth and opportunity seen in Baltimore's emerging black middle-class. Notable individual advocates in this period include not only religious leaders like Rev. Harvey Johnson (1843–1923), but business owners like Isaac Myers (1835–1891) and black lawyers and professionals like Everett J. Waring (1859–1914) and Harry S. Cummings (1866-1917). Major organizations included the Mutual United Brotherhood of Liberty (1885). Outside of Baltimore, major factors include the national resurgence of white supremacist cultural beliefs and ideas (exemplified in the reframing of  Civil War memory around the "Lost Cause") and the federal government retreat from enforcing Civil Rights for African Americans.

## Introduction

Between 1870 and 1905, African Americans in Baltimore and Maryland witnessed both new opportunities and difficult reversals in the face of growing acceptance of racist beliefs and a uncertain base of support that struggled to challenge overturn racist policies. In this period, Baltimore's black population grew quickly—from 54,000 in 1880 to 79,000 in 1900. This growth was driven largely by migration of African Americans from southern Maryland, the Eastern Shore and, by the early twentieth century, Virginia. Many of these migrants fled from the poverty and violence against African Americans, exemplified by the thirty-one lynchings that took place between 1882 and 1911.

## How did the history of Civil Rights change within this period?

- African American demands for housing reshaped the city (?)
- African Americans organized within and independent of the Republican party to fight voter disenfranchisement
- Fight for equal education, housing, etc. shifted with separate but equal

### Housing segregation

As the city’s black population grew, it also become more concentrated and segregated from the city’s population of native-born whites and European immigrants. Even as late as 1880, the city’s black population could be found distributed evenly over three-quarters of Baltimore’s 20 wards and 8 districts. By 1890, however, African Americans began to concentrate in 11th Ward (the neighborhood of Biddle Alley) where a little over 11,000 of the 21,2699 residents were African American (making the ward 51.74% black). By 1904, the city’s Northwestern District (including the 11th Ward) held more than 40% of Baltimore’s 81,381 African Americans.[^1]

### Black organizing

These new residents joined existing institutions like churches and fraternal organizations but also started new organizations. In February 1880, a convention of "colored delegates from each ward of the city" met at the Douglass Institute on Lexington Street to organize a new “Equal-Rights League.” The meeting heard speeches from Rev. John A. Handy, James Taylor, N.C.M. Groome, [Isaac Myers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Myers) and [Jeremiah Haralson](http://history.house.gov/People/Listing/H/HARALSON,-Jeremiah-(H000179)/). Myers observed how in Maryland:

> "Colored men cannot sit upon juries, colored children cannot be taught in the public schools by teachers of their own race, and colored people cannot get accommodations in hotels nor be admitted to practice as lawyers in State courts. By units of action the colored people will secure these rights and privileges."

Harrison, a former Congressman from Alabama who had been forced by an armed mob to flee the state in 1878, remarked that the "colored people in Maryland are free compared with their race in Alabama and the far South, where they are now fleeing from 'a second slavery that is more damnable than the first.'" The discussion continued past midnight before the meeting concluded with a resolution:

> "They set forth that neither the republican nor democratic parties in this State accord equal rights to the colored man, and the organization is promoted to secure him his rights and the respect to which he is entitled as a citizen."

This movement to independent black organizations led to changes for African Americans churches as well as political parties. In 1885, [Rev. Harvey Johnson](http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/stagser/s1259/121/6050/html/12414000.html) (1843-1923) founded the Order of Regulators, another early Civil Rights organization, which Johnson renamed the Brotherhood of Liberty in 1887. Under Rev. Johnson’s leadership, the Union Baptist Church withdrew from the 1892, the Union Baptist Church withdrew from the Maryland Baptist Union Association in response to discriminatory pay for black pastors and unequal privileges for black churches within the government of the association. In September 1897, Rev. Johnson delivered a speech in Boston, titled "A Plea For Our Work As Colored Baptists, Apart From the Whites,” that criticized white churches for their failure to support black Civil Rights efforts:

> “Why is the proposition never made to us of the necessity of co-operating in the work of abating the many forms of legal and socially oppressive laws and customs now in vogue all over the country, both North and South?”

In 1898, Rev. Johnson organized the Colored Baptist Convention of Maryland.

During the same period, between 1856 and 1900, thirty-one black newspapers were established in Baltimore. In 1892, [John H. Murphy, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Murphy,_Sr.) (1841-1922), a U.S. Colored Troop veteran, established the Afro-American newspaper by merging his own church newsletter _The Sunday School Helper_ with two other publications, _The Ledger_, established in 1882 by [Rev. George Freeman Bragg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Freeman_Bragg), rector of St. James Episcopal Church since 1891, and _The Afro-American_, published by Reverend William M. Alexander, Sharon Baptist Church.

Despite the promise represented by the Thirteenth (1865), Fourteenth (1868) and Fifteenth (1870) Amendments, elected officials at the local, state and federal consistently failed to protect the rights of black Baltimoreans. As the state remained part of the Union during the Civil War, Maryland never went through a period of Reconstruction.

The ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 added 39,000 new black voters to the total of 131,000 white voters registered in the state. Despite African American men voting in support of the Republicans, the Democratic Party candidate won the Governor’s office in every election from 1866 to 1896. Similarly, the Mayor of Baltimore remained Democratic (or a related party) from [Mayor Robert T. Banks](http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/012400/012477/html/12477bio.html) (the first elected under the new State Constitution adopted in 1867) up until the election of Alcaeus Hooper in 1895.

At the federal level, the withdrawal of Union troops from the South marked the end of Reconstruction and, as the _NHL Civil Rights Framework_ notes, “the concept of equal rights collapsed in the wake of legislative and judicial actions”, continuing:

> The Republican and Democratic parties sacrificed civil rights in exchange for white southern votes. In the _Civil Rights Cases_ of 1883, the U.S. Supreme Court found the statutory guarantee of equal enjoyment of public accommodations unconstitutional on the grounds that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment only applied to state activities and did not permit federal control of individual actions.  This decision greatly limited the rights of blacks and strengthened Jim Crow laws in the South.

## Separate but equal

Between 1883 and 1905, the Maryland General Assembly passed a series of regressive measures to promote and enforce racial discrimination. These including an 1884 law banning interracial marriage (reaffirming a ban on interracial marriage from 1664), 1904 measures to require “Jim Crow” racial segregation on railroad coaches and steamboats, and a 1905 measure to disenfranchise African Americans (rejected at the polls by Maryland voters). The limited success of these efforts in Maryland in comparison to other Southern states is notable—reflecting both the size and the organization of Baltimore’s African American community.

- Public School No. 111 (built 1889, extant)
- Douglass Place (built 1892, extant)
- Laurel Cemetery (established 1851, nonextant)
- Mount Auburn Cemetery (established 1873, extant)

## Why did these changes take place?

- White support for white supremacy grew at the local, state and national levels
- Black institutions continued to expand following the Civil War

## White supremacy

In Maryland, as well as many other Southern states, African Americans fought to preserve their right to vote, their right to equal accommodation on public transportation, and their right to fair housing opportunities. Their efforts were met with opposition and resistance by racist white Marylanders.

Changes in public policy paralleled changes to the broader culture, including the growing cultural significance of the “Lost Cause”, social darwinism and scientific racism contributed to a difficult situation. This change is reflected in part through a memorial landscape in Baltimore that celebrated Confederate supporters and Confederate symbols including those built after the period of this context:

- Roger Brooke Taney Monument (1887)
- Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument (1903)
- Confederate Women’s Monument (1917)
- Lee-Jackson Monument (1948)

Additional examples can be found in the work of [William Cabell Bruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cabell_Bruce), a Baltimore lawyer who published _[The Negro Problem](https://archive.org/details/negroproblem00bruc)_ in 1891. Later examples include the 1905 novel and play [The Clansmen: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clansman:_An_Historical_Romance_of_the_Ku_Klux_Klan) (which toured in Baltimore) and, more famously, the 1915 film [The Birth of a Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_a_Nation).
