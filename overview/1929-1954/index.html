        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Baltimore’s black population had grown dramatically during the 1920s, slowed modestly during the 1930s, but then grew quickly during and after WWII. The city’s black population grew from 142,106 in 1930 to 225,099 in 1950 — an increase of nearly 60% outpacing the more modest rate of 18% growth for the city’s overall population in the same period. In addition, African American residents went from 17.66% of the population in 1930 to 23.70% of the population in 1950. The growth of segregated white suburban communities in Baltimore County in this period accounted for some of the change as the County population more than doubled from 124,565 in 1930 to 270,273 in 1950.</p>
<p>The Great Depression that began with the stock market crash in October 1929 presented major challenges for African Americans in Baltimore. Black workers were excluded from most local unions and were subject to the policy of “last hired and first fired” leading to widespread job loss. In 1934, 13% of Baltimore whites and 40% of Baltimore blacks were on relief (?) according to a study by the Baltimore Urban League. While the federal government’s New Deal programs brought some relief, discrimination persisted even in the administration of these programs. The <em>Afro-American</em> reported that an African American household with eight people recieved $8.94 a week for food but a white household of the same size recieved $12.70.<span class="citation" data-cites="farrar_baltimore_1998"><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Despite the dramatic challenges African Americans in Baltimore faced during the Great Depression, the period was one of renewal and growth for the city’s Civil Rights movement. In 1934, Thurgood Marshall began working for the local chapter of the NAACP and, in 1935, Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson took over as the president of the chapter. Jackson’s leadership turned the local chapter from a struggling organization into one of the largest chapters in the country and, together with Thurgood Marshall and others, pioneered a strategy of legal attacks on segregated education that eventually led to the landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954). Jackson’s daughter Juanita Jackson organized the City-Wide Young Peoples Forum beginning in 1931 (?) which inspired a broader “Buy Where You Can Work” campaign protesting discriminatory hiring by businesses on Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
<p>Interracial organizations and white activists also played an important role in this period. The American Communist Party (established in 1919) expanded their advocacy for Civil Rights in Maryland during the 1930s and the ACLU of Maryland was founded on March 8, 1931, and Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) (founded in Chicago in March 1942) emerged in Baltimore in the early 1950s out of years of interracial organizing efforts.</p>
<p>The beginning of World War II in 1941 and the fast growth of the city’s black population during the war created new challenges. After a Baltimore City police officer shot and killed a black private from Pittsburgh, Civil Rights activists organized the 1942 March on Annapolis—the largest Civil Rights demonstration in the history of the state—and won important new changes</p>
<p>The election of Republican Mayor Theodore McKeldin (after over a decade of leadership by Democratic Mayor Howard W. Jackson) provide African American leaders with a new ally after years of frustration. Seeking to elect more Civil Rights supportive candidates to office, in 1943, the Baltimore chapter of the NAACP organized their first major Register-and-Vote campaign. On December 3, 1946, Victorine Adams held the first meeting of the Colored Women’s Democratic Campaign Committee which led to the election of Harry A. Cole to the Maryland General Assembly, the first African American to serve in that role.</p>
<p>A growing acceptance of the need for change is also seen in the moves such as the Sunpapers of Baltimore dropping racial designation from news headlines in 1946 and the Negro Art Show held at the Baltimore Museum of Art in 1947.</p>

<p>The places associated with these events included those buildings created for use by African Americans under policies of segregation like Frederick Douglass High School (built 1924) or the Edgar Allan Poe Homes (built 1938). However, they also include places that served as sites of conflict in the fight against segregation such as Catonsville High School (built 1925) which is closely associated with the case of Williams v. Zimmerman (1937); the Enoch Pratt Free Library – Branch No. 1 (built 1886) where librarian Kerr was assigned to work after her success in the case of Kerr v. Pratt Library (1945); or the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, North Avenue and Calvert Street (built 1913) which began to desegregate on a limited basis in 1952. Private homes also served as important meeting places such as the Dr. John E.T. Camper House (built c. 1885) at 639 N. Carey Street or the Dr. Carl J. Murphy House in Morgan Park.</p>

<p>Lynching and criminal injustice was at the center of black organizing and advocacy around Civil Rights and racial injustice in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Such cases highlighted the important role of the Communist Party in supporting African American Civil Rights as a strategy for build supporting among African Americans broadly.</p>
<p>On March 25, 1931, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottsboro_Boys">Scottsboro Boys</a> were arrested and charged with rape in Scottsboro, Alabama — a case closely followed by the Afro-American newspaper. On December 4, 1931, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Williams_(laborer)">Matthew Williams</a> was lynched at Salisbury, Maryland—as the Maryland Historical Society <a href="http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2012/11/29/an-american-tragedy/">underbelly blog</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On December 4, 1931, Matthew Williams, an African American man, shot and killed his white employer in Salisbury and then turned the gun on himself in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. That evening, a mob of more than a thousand dragged Williams from his hospital bed where he lay critically wounded, and hung him up on the courthouse lawn. His body was then dragged to the town’s African American business district, and set on fire.  The Williams murder was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882, and the first since 1911.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On October 14, 1931, Euel Lee, known as “Orphan Jones”, was arrested for the murder of a white family reportedly over a disagreement about wages. The Maryland Communist Party took Lee’s case and lawyer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Ades">Bernard Ades</a> successfully moved Lee’s trial to Towson in Baltimore County. Ultimately, Ades lost the case (Lee was executed on October 28, 1933) but in the process helped to combat the informal prohibition on black jurors in Baltimore County.</p>
<!-- TODO: What is the citation for the above passage on Bernard Ades? -->
<p>Two years later, on October 18, 1935:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a mob of a thousand or more people stormed into the Princess Anne jail house and hauled Armwood from his cell down to the street below. Before he was hung from a tree some distance away, Armwood was dragged through the streets, beaten, stabbed, and had one ear hacked off.  Armwood’s lifeless body was then paraded through the town, finally ending up near the town’s courthouse, where the mob doused the corpse with gasoline and set it on fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1948, for the first time in the history of Maryland, a white man was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape of a black woman.</p>
<h2 id="opportunities-for-employment">Opportunities for employment</h2>
<p>In the 1930s, African American activists put growing pressure on public and private employers to end segregated hiring and begin offering more opportunities to African American workers. This pressure included both a renewed legal efforts backed by the NAACP at the local and national level and a series of grass-roots protest actions organized by activist groups like CORE, inter-religious coalitions like the Baltimore Council of Churches, and by students (especially from Morgan State College). Another important supporter of reform were black professional organizations such as the Progressive Engineers Association of Maryland (organized in 1938) and the MeDeSo (a club for black physicians and dentists established by Dr. J.E.T. Camper and others in 1942).</p>
<p>An early sign of progress came in July 1937 when the Baltimore Police Department hired Violet Hill Whyte as the city’s first black police officer. Whyte, however, was not a uniform officer and did not carry a gun as part of her work. In 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 which established Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) and lay a foundation for broader activism against discriminatory hiring. Such efforts were frustrated, however, by the weak support of many industrial unions for black workers and the racism of white workers. This challenge is exemplified in the example of Bethlehem Steel in 1943 (?) when white workers walked off the job in protest over the hiring of black workers.</p>
<p>Public workers had more success in the years after WWII than some private workers. In 1945, the NAACP won a critical legal victory to end a segregated training program at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in the case of Kerr v. Enoch Pratt Free Library (1945). In 1953, the Baltimore City Fire Department appointed their first African American firemen. In 1949, the Baltimore City Medical Society, a local professional association for doctors, voted to admit African American members.</p>
