## Summary

Between 1831 and 1870, black and white Baltimoreans organized in new ways to resist the Colonization movement, advocate for black schools, and promote abolition and emancipation. These intersecting efforts were supported by Baltimore's growing free black population and the growing strength of black institutions, including Sharp Street Church (1797) and Orchard Street Church (1837). Local black religious leaders and educators, including William Watkins (1803–1858), John Fortie, Trueman Pratt (1775–1877), advocated for the broader community of black Baltimoreans in petitioning city government and worked to shape the views of sympathetic white abolitionists. Outside of Baltimore, the northern abolition movement, the economic challenges following the Panic of 1837 and 1857, and the sweeping changes brought by the Civil War also helped to shape these local changes.

## Introduction

In 1831, over 17,888 free people of color and 10,653 enslaved African Americans called Baltimore home. Free black men and women living in Maryland could not vote and could not testify in any criminal trial. Their children could not attend Baltimore’s public schools. White employers excluded black workers from all but the most difficult and dangerous jobs in the city’s growing industrial economy.

By 1870, 330,741 African Americans lived in Baltimore City and County. Black men could vote and black children could attend segregated public schools. Aspiring black teachers could enroll for training at the Baltimore Normal School (established 1865) or the Centenary Biblical Institute established (established 1867), institutions that continue in the present as Coppin State University and Morgan State University.

Over a period of 39 years, local organizing and the changes brought by the Civil War brought dramatic transformations to the lives of Baltimore’s African American residents. The issues and approaches developed at this time continued to drive Baltimore’s African American Civil Rights movement through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

## How did the history of Civil Rights change within this period?

At the beginning of this period, Baltimore’s free people of color and enslaved people faced growing hostility from city and state leaders and many of Baltimore’s white residents. Following the events of [Nat Turner’s slave rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner%27s_slave_rebellion) in Southampton, Virginia, on August 21, 1831, panicked slaveholders in Maryland placed new restrictions on free and enslaved blacks and encouraged free blacks to move out of Maryland. The Maryland state legislature moved in 1832 to prohibit free blacks from entering the state, banned free black Marylanders from owning firearms without a certificate from county officials and outlawed the sale of alcohol, powder, and shot to blacks. Under the new policies, African Americans could longer hold religious meetings unless a white minister is present except in Baltimore City. Efforts to impose new restrictions continued later with the [Fugitive Slave Act of 1850](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850), new restrictions on free blacks approved in 1854, and the “black codes" added to the Maryland Code of Public General Laws in 1860.

In response to these challenges and others, black community leaders, groups representing the black community, and allied white individuals and organizations, worked together to:

1. Resist to the Colonization movement in Maryland
2. Organize schools for black Baltimoreans
3. Promote abolition and emancipation of enslaved African Americans

### Resistance to the Colonization movement

In _Freedom's Port: The African American Community of Baltimore, 1790-1860_, historian Christopher Phillips recounts African American resistance to the efforts by the Maryland Colonization Society to encourage free blacks to migrate from Maryland to Liberia, noting:

> The pervasively hostile sentiment against colonization throughout the period and the equally persuasive demeanor of the Baltimore junto forced the Maryland Colonization Society to abandon recruitment effort on the state's Western Shore. Of the emigrants sponsored by the Maryland State Colonization Society between 1832 and 1841, only fifty (less than 8 percent) were from Baltimore. [@phillips_freedoms_1997, 226]

Not all black Baltimoreans opposed colonization (most famously [Daniel Coker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coker) – founding pastor of Bethel AME Church who emigrated to Liberia in 1820) but, as Phillips writes, the "conflict over colonization offered black Baltimoreans the opportunity to further the evolution of their own community as distinct and autonomous.” Phillips continued to note:

> Whether for or against colonization, Baltimore's black community unified around a principle far more compelling; racial progress. Baltimore's black society became, in the words of one historian of urban African Americans of the antebellum North, a "community of commitment.” [@phillips_freedoms_1997, 226]

### Creating schools for black Baltimoreans

<!-- QUESTION: Is it important to note the interracial character of organizing on this theme? Does that make it distinct from the prior theme? -->

Expanding educational opportunities for black Baltimoreans and employment opportunities for black educators was a key goal in the broader efforts of "racial progress" articulated by the movement opposing colonization.

In 1797, the Maryland Society for the Abolition of Slavery, a Quaker abolitionist group, opened the Baltimore African Academy for the children of free black parents—the first schools for African Americans in Baltimore. In 1826, the General Assembly of Maryland authorized the creation of the Baltimore City school system for white children under the age of ten and the first school, known as Public School No. 1, opened on September 21, 1829. Public Schools No. 2 and 3 opened soon after and by the end of the year, enrolled 269 students. African Americans recognized the injustice of being forced to pay school taxes that supported only white schools, Africans American leaders in Baltimore petitioned the city government to provide either tax relief or schools for black children in 1839, 1844, and 1850. In each case, the Mayor and City Council rejected the petitions, despite the 1850 petition having signatures from 90 black and 126 white Baltimore residents.

 In 1864, a group of thirty white businessmen, lawyers and ministers (mostly Quakers) formed the Baltimore Association for the Moral and Educational Improvement of Colored People with the goal of establishing a black public school system. Within a year, the group had established seven schools in Baltimore with 3,000 students enrolled. At their peak in 1867, the group had set up more than 100 schools in Baltimore and on the Eastern Shore. [@baum_brown_2011, 25-26]

### Abolition and emancipation

Baltimore’s significant place in the broader debate around abolition and emancipation is secured in part through the city’s connection to [Frederick Douglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass). Born into slavery around February 1818, Frederick Douglass first arrived in Baltimore around 1828. On September 3, 1838, Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery in Baltimore, traveling by train to New York City, and soon moving again to New Bedford, Massachusetts.

Abolitionists and people who assisted enslaved people in escaping from bondage faced significant risks. In early 1842, [Charles Turner Torrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Turner_Torrey) organized an Underground Railroad route from Washington to Baltimore, Philadelphia and Albany. Torrey moved to Baltimore in late 1843 and, in June 1844, was arrested and confined to the Maryland Penitentiary. Torrey died in prison from tuberculosis on May 9, 1846 but the story of his life and death (published in 1847 as the _[Memoir of Rev. Charles T. Torrey who died in the penitentiary of Maryland, where he was confined for showing mercy to the poor](https://archive.org/details/memoirofrevcharl00love2)_)  inspired action from abolitionists throughout the United States and Europe.

The passage of the [Fugitive Slave Act of 1850](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850), pushed by Southern slaveholders to stem the flow of enslaved people moving north to freedom, led to expanded efforts by abolitionists to support the Underground Railroad and growing violence on both sides. One notable early challenge to the Fugitive Slave Act came in 1851 is the Christiana Riot (also known as the Christiana Resistance), where Baltimore-area slaveholder Edward Gorsuch and several others wounded seeking to recapture four enslaved men who had escaped to the farm of abolitionist [William Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Parker_(abolitionist)) in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

This first dramatic expansion of rights and opportunities for African Americans in Baltimore was shaped by a variety of

## Why did these changes take place?

Several local factors shaped the changing context for Civil Rights within this period, including:

1. The growing free back population before and after the Civil War
2. The growing strength of black churches and fraternal organizations
3. Local and national economic challenges in the decades before the Civil War
4. Federal support for black rights during and after the Civil War

### Changing population

Even in 1831, the growing size of Baltimore’s free black population marked a significant change in patterns of slave-holding in Baltimore and Maryland at the beginning of the 19th century. Between 1800 and 1860, the proportion of Baltimore city residents who held slaves declined, the share of Baltimore’s total population held in slavery declined and the share of the black population living in freedom grew. Nearly one-third of city residents held at least one enslaved person in 1800. In 1850, slaveholders made up just over one-percent of the city’s white population. Enslaved people made up 9% of the city’s population in 1790, just under 2% in 1850, and barely 1% in 1860. A small minority of the city’s African Americans, just 20%, were free in 1790. By 1830, over 75% of the same population was free and over 90% in 1860.[@phillips_freedoms_1997, 16-26]

### Black churches and fraternal organizations

The city’s growing black population supported the growth of both existing black churches and the foundation of new churches and religious organizations. Churches established (or expanded) within this period include:

- Sharp Street Church (1787, nonextant)
- Bethel AME Church (c. 1817, nonextant)
- St. James Episcopal Church (1824, nontextant)
- Oblate Sisters of Providence (1828, nonextant)
- Orchard Street Church (1837, rebuilt 1859, 1882, extant)
- Union Baptist Church (1852, nontextant)
- Ebenezer AME Church (1865, extant)

This period began with
These restrictions made life difficult for African Americans in Baltimore and many sought their freedom by leaving Baltimore for northern states or Canada. For example, Example from 1840 via [The Slave Rebellion Website](http://slaverebellion.org/index.php?page=united-states-insurrections):

> In October a large number of slaves on a plantation in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, rebelled. The rebellion appears to have been spontaneous. The overseer was seriously wounded and the slaves resisted the local police. All the rebels were captured except one, and one slave was shot. What happened to them is not known. [@northup_twelve_1895, 246-248]

Example from 1845 via [The Slave Rebellion Website](http://slaverebellion.org/index.php?page=united-states-insurrections):

> In Charles County, Maryland there was an insurrection of slaves and free Blacks. One slave was hanged, several others sold out of the State, and the free Blacks were given 40 years in prison. [@brackett_negro_1889, 95-96]

In April 1861, after months of pressure from members of the state legislature, [Governor Hicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Holliday_Hicks) convened a special session of the assembly to consider a “course of action”—but lawmakers ultimately declined to consider secession ending the discussion for good. Other proposals for Maryland to stay “neutral” in the fight went nowhere.

According to the Maryland Historical Society [Guide to Civil War Sources](https://www.mdhs.org/sites/default/files/Civil_War.pdf):

> “It is estimated that up to 60,000 Marylanders fought for the Union during the Civil War.  Maryland raised 20 infantry and four cavalry regiments for Union service, along with six artillery batteries.  There were no official Maryland troops in the Confederacy, but sympathetic Marylanders organized infantry, cavalry, and artillery units.  Others joined military outfits from other states.  As many as 25,000 Marylanders fought for the South in the war.  On the whole, those officers who fought for the Confederacy tended to represent the landed gentry of Maryland, while Union officers were more likely to be farmers or artisans.  Those Marylanders fighting for the Confederacy suffered greater combat losses than those who sided with the North.

A variety of forces began to challenge slavery early in the war. In April 1862, the emancipation of enslaved people in Washington, DC created new opportunities for enslaved blacks to escape from bondage. In 1863, the federal government began recruiting for the new U.S. Colored Troops, enlisting over 8,700 black men in six Maryland regiments.

In 1864, Maryland passed a new state constitution abolishing slavery and disenfranchised Marylanders who had left the state to fight for or live in the Confederacy and those who supported the Confederacy within the state. Under this arrangement the Maryland legislature approved the the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery throughout the nation on February 3, 1865. However, with the restoration of voting rights for many Confederate sympathizers or veterans following the end of the Civil War, the Maryland State Legislature specifically rejected the Fourteenth Amendment (guaranteeing the rights of citizens and other persons) on March 23, 1867. Three years later, the state rejected the Fifteenth Amendment on February 26, 1870. The passage of the 14th Amendment and 15th Amendment to the Constitution  passage of the 14th and 15th amendments, etc. Maryland only ratified the amendments well after they came into effect: 1959 (for the 14th) and 1973 (for the 15th).
