  <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The period between 1905 and 1929 a continuation of the challenges of the late 19th century. However, the early 20th century also saw an expanded effort by African American activists to build national organizations and more effective coalitions with white supporters. As in other American cities, the Progressive Era (1900-1920) saw major changes to Baltimore’s urban landscape including a new park plan, a new sewer system, and a downtown transformed by the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904. Migration of African Americans from rural Maryland and Virginia continued reshaping the black neighborhoods and housing. The presentation of the Great Migration as a “crisis” for Baltimore and Maryland helped to drive campaigns in favor of segregated housing and racially disparities in policing.</p>
<p>The first several decades of the 20th century saw tremendous changes at both the local and national level driven during the Progressive Era World War I (1914-1918), and the Great Depression (1929-1939). The city’s overall population grew from around 509,000 in 1900 to 859,000 in 1940. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, huge numbers of African-Americans moved to Baltimore from rural counties in Maryland and Virginia; reflecting a pattern of migration that led to dramatic growth in the black population of Washington, New York City, and Philadelphia. The city’s black population grew from 79,000 in 1900 to 84,000 in 1910.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: What are the labor and housing issues related to race and Civil Rights during World War I?</p>
<p>This growing population led to a growing number of churches and a slow expansion of Baltimore’s black public schools. Most African Americans lived, went to school, and worshipped in buildings originally erected for white Baltimoreans but sold to African Americans or converted to use by African Americans following the persistent demands of black leaders and over the determined resistance of white opponents. Examples that illustrate this transition include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public School 103</strong> was built on Division Street in 1877 and changed from serving white to black students in 1910 when it was first used for students from nearby Public School No. 112. In March 1911, the school was officially designated Public School 103.</li>
<li><strong>Western Female High School</strong> erected at Lafayette Avenue and McCulloh Street in 1896 with the annex completed in 1911. In January 1928, Western High School moved to a new building at Pulaski Street and Gwynns Falls Parkway and the Coppin Normal School, Colored Junior High School, and offices for the Baltimore colored school administration moved into the building on McCulloh Street.</li>
<li><strong>Union Baptist Church</strong> moved located on Guilford Avenue between E. Lexington and E. Saratoga Streets. Union Baptist moved to Druid Hill Avenue in 1910.</li>
<li><strong>Bethel AME Church</strong> purchased their building at Lanvale Street and Druid Hill Avenue from St. Peter’s Protestant Episcopal Church on November 20, 1910 for $90,000 and held a dedication service on January 8, 1911.</li>
</ul>
<p>This period saw a major growth in national Civil Rights organizing efforts, beginning with the Niagara Movement in 1905. In 1905, Rev. Harvey Johnson and four other members of the Brotherhood of Liberty were among the twenty-nine people from fourteen states who met near Buffalo, New York to form the organization. Historian Bettye Collier-Thomas noted that W.E.B. DuBois was in “close contact with members of the Brotherhood… as he frequently traveled there to deliver speeches” between 1895 and 1910. Collier-Thomas notes, that the Brotherhood “willingly shared twenty years of experience, strategy development and know-how with the founders at Niagara.” The Niagara Movement ended after just a few years but led to the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. The National Urban League, organized with a clear focus on the needs of black migrants to northern and border state cities was established just a year later in 1910.</p>
<p>Local connections to national organizations are also visible in the example of the Negro Business League holding their Ninth Annual Convention in Baltimore in 1908. The local chapter of the NAACP was established in Baltimore on April 4, 1912. Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) erected a new building for the Druid Hill Avenue Branch in 1919.</p>
<p>Decades of organizing and advocacy yielded some progress. For example, in 1920, the Baltimore YWCA and Colored Women’s YWCA merged—reflecting a growing commitment by white liberals to form and support interracial organizations. Similarly, in 1927, the Maryland state legislature established the “Interracial Commission” (Chapter 559, Acts of 1927) to create a framework for discussing Civil Rights policy issues. Unfortunately, the immediate impact of such modest and incremental changes to improve the lives of black people in Baltimore was limited.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, white supremacist organizations continued to persist despite some controversy and opposition. In early 1923, the Ku Klux Klan presented a charity circus in Hazazer’s Hall (where?) and publicized the Klan’s endorsement of Protestantism. Visits were made to the United Brethren Church (where?) and the Roland Avenue Methodist Church at 40th Street and Roland Avenue. The pastor of the latter church accepted a $25 check from the Klan, remarking, “I, for one, am glad to get it.” In March 1923, a Klan meeting at the Brooklyn First Baptist Church at 3801 5th Street was “almost broken up by an angry mob.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
