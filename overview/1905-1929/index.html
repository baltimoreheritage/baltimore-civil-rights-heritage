        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Baltimore’s urban landscape experienced major changes during the first three decades of the 20th century. Following the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904, the city rebuilt the downtown area and, 1915, the city dedicated a new sanitary sewer system after decades of delay. In 1918, Baltimore City annexed a large area of Baltimore County. The benefits of this growth, however, went largely to white Baltimoreans. Black Baltimoreans saw the aggressive enforcement of racial housing segregation, continued discrimination against black workers, and woefully unequal conditions for black students and teachers in the city’s public schools.</p>

</figure>
<p>Overall, the city’s population grew from around 509,000 in 1900 to 733,826 in 1920, reaching 804,874 people by 1930. The city’s black population grew from 79,000 in 1900 to 84,000 in 1910 to 108,322 in 1920 and 142,106 in 1930.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In the antebellum period, most of the new black migrants to Baltimore City came from Maryland or Virginia — a pattern that mostly continued into the early 20th century. In 1910, 87% of the black population in Baltimore was native to Maryland. Of the 13% born outside of the state, migrants from Virginia made up 8.7% of the total. In 1920, 76% of Baltimore’s black population was native to Maryland, in comparison to Detroit’s 8.4% or Manhattan’s 20.9%. By 1930, Baltimore had 59.4% of black residents (142,106 people) born in the state – a decline of 17.1% from 1910.<span class="citation" data-cites="reich_baltimore_2014"><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<!-- TODO: Find out about the patterns of migration to Baltimore during the Great Migration. The 1910 and 1920 population numbers referenced above are clearly approximate. -->
<!-- TODO: Write about economic challenges during this period, e.g. Panic of 1901, Panic of 1903, economic downturn following WWI, and the start of the Great Depression -->
<p>This growing black population moved into northwest Baltimore concentrated by segregation in housing and public schools. Still today, many buildings with important associations to this period of Civil Rights history survive within the Old West Baltimore National Register Historic District (including the neighborhoods of Madison Park, Upton, Druid Heights, Harlem Park, and Sandtown-Winchester). For example, the former St. Peter’s P.E. Church (built 1868) was purchased by Bethel A.M.E. Church in 1910. Public School No. 103 (built 1877) was converted to use as black school the same year. The Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA), Druid Hill Avenue Branch was built in 1919. In 1928, the Coppin Normal School, Colored Junior High School, and offices for the Baltimore colored school administration moved into the former Western High School building on McCulloh Street. Black occupancy and activism was not limited to West Baltimore, however, as seen in the Morgan Park neighborhood near Morgan State University where development began in 1917.</p>
<!-- TODO: Decide if it makes sense to note Preston Gardens (built 1917) as a significant site in this period. -->
<p>The efforts of Civil Rights activists in the late nineteenth century had preserved the franchise for black voters but legal setbacks such as Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and Berea College v. Kentucky (1908) opened the way to new restrictions on public accommodations and education African American residents in Baltimore. While other decisions, like Buchanan v. Warley (1917) – a case that overturned the successor to Baltimore’s 1910 housing segregation ordinance, offered some hope for equal protection, overall African American activists were frustrated in the courts. Even worse, in the streets of many American cities, black citizens faced the threat of terrible violence from their white neighbors with no hope of equal protection from local police.</p>
<p>In Baltimore, notable individual activists and leaders during this period included City Councilman Harry S. Cummings (1866–1917); lawyers Everett J. Waring (1859–1914), Warner T. McGuinn (1859–1937), and George W. F. McMechen (1871–1961); editor Carl J. Murphy (1889–1967); pastor and educator Rev. James Robert Lincoln Diggs (1866-1922) at Trinity Baptist Church. Significant organizations included the NAACP (established in 1909, with a Baltimore chapter beginning in 1912) and the Baltimore Urban League (established nationally in 1910, with a Baltimore chapter beginning in 1924). The <em>Afro-American Newspaper</em> under the editorial leadership of Carl Murphy (beginning with the death of John Murphy, Sr. in 1922) also became a vocal proponent of Civil Rights in Baltimore, exemplified by efforts such as the newspaper’s campaign against segregated buses and discrimination by bus drivers along Howard Street in July 1929.<span class="citation" data-cites="farrar_baltimore_1998"><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Other important groups included the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL) (established in 1914 with a Baltimore chapter operating by 1918); fraternal organizations such as the Monumental Lodge No. 3; and philanthropic groups such as the CYWCA (founded in 1896) and the Colored Fresh Air and Empty Stocking Circle (established in 1904 by Ida Cummings and other members of the CYWCA).</p>
<p>These advocates worked in different ways and some likely avoided the label of Civil Rights activism as they worked to continue the city’s long tradition of mutual support. Despite the disparate character of activism in this period, a set of themes do emerge as activist worked to:</p>
<ul>
<li>continue to fight white efforts to impose housing segregation on black households and disenfranchise black voters.</li>
<li>continue to protest lynchings, mob violence, and criminal injustice directed against African Americans in Baltimore, across the state of Maryland, and across the country.</li>
<li>work to improve housing conditions and educational opportunities for African Americans in Baltimore</li>
<li>expand of voting rights for women (including African American women) and the role of black women as organizers and activists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, local Civil Rights activism in Baltimore in this period was increasingly tied to a broader national context and national movement. In 1905, Rev. Harvey Johnson and four other members of the Brotherhood of Liberty were among the twenty-nine people from fourteen states who met near Buffalo, New York to form the Niagra Movement. Historian Bettye Collier-Thomas suggested that W.E.B. DuBois was in “close contact with members of the Brotherhood… as he frequently traveled there to deliver speeches” between 1895 and 1910. Collier-Thomas noted that the Brotherhood “willingly shared twenty years of experience, strategy development and know-how with the founders at Niagara.”<span class="citation" data-cites="collier-thomas_harvey_1991"><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> The Niagara Movement ended after just a few years but led directly to the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909.</p>
<!-- TODO: Add more information about the annexation and how it affected the city. Find 1920 and 1930 data for black population growth. -->
<h2 id="resistance-to-segregation-and-disenfranchisement">Resistance to segregation and disenfranchisement</h2>
<p>During the early twentieth century, a coalition of African American activists and recent European immigrants worked together under the banner of the Maryland Suffrage League to defeat a series of proposals to limit the franchise for black voters. Republican party leaders like prominent Baltimore lawyer Charles J. Bonaparte also played an important role in rallying opposition to these proposals, as historian Jane L. Phelps described Bonaparte’s opposition to the Poe and Strauss Amendments in 1905 and 1908.<span class="citation" data-cites="phelps_charles_1959"><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> Ultimately these efforts succeeded, defeating the Poe Amendment in a vote of 104,286 to 70,227 in 1905. In 1908, voters defeated the similar Strauss disenfranchisement bill more narrowly 106,069 to 98,808. Maryland voters defeated a third attempt, the Digges Amendment, more clearly in 1910: about 84,000 to 46,000.<span class="citation" data-cites="smith_here_2008"><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Like disenfranchisement, segregation was an attempt to ensure social control, as historian Carl Nightingale observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jim Crow ordinances segregating rail and trolley cars, theaters, restaurants and other public amenities signaled Southern whites’ final rejection of physical proximity as a method of social control, and their embrace of distance.<span class="citation" data-cites="nightingale_transnational_2006"><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baltimore’s 1910 housing segregation bill has been well-studied by historians including Garrett Power<span class="citation" data-cites="power_apartheid_1983"><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span> and, more Carl Nightingale<span class="citation" data-cites="nightingale_transnational_2006"><a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span>, Sam Roberts<span class="citation" data-cites="jr_infectious_2009"><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span>, Gretchen Boger<span class="citation" data-cites="boger_meaning_2009"><a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span>, and Dennis Halpin.<span class="citation" data-cites="halpin_reforming_2012"><a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In fights over housing segregation, black advocates had fewer allies. proved a more difficult - 1910, housing segregation law - 1917, Morgan College moves to northeast Baltimore, unsuccessful suit by neighbors to keep it from moving there - Buchanan v. Warley (1917)</p>
<p>Dennis Halpin notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the end of the 1910s, black Baltimoreans resistance to the ordinances remade the city’s racial geography. Nevertheless, they struggled to challenge the strategies segregationists used in the wake of the laws’ demise.<span class="citation" data-cites="halpin_reforming_2012"><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But shift to focus on exclusion through other means, e.g. “protective” associations,</p>
<h2 id="mob-violence-and-anti-lynching-advocacy">Mob violence and anti-lynching advocacy</h2>
<p>This period saw a surge of white violence against African Americans in Maryland and in cities around the country. One example from Maryland, notable for the proximity to Baltimore, was the lynching of King Johnson in Brooklyn, Maryland on December 26, 1911.<span class="citation" data-cites="maryland_state_archives_king_2015"><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Beyond individual lynchings, black communities around the country had to contend with the threat of violent anti-black riots by white neighbors (examples in the table below).</p>

<p>These events took place concurrently with the local and national resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan. On October 10, 1922, the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in Annapolis and organized other rallies in Frederick and Baltimore that same year. In early 1923, the Ku Klux Klan presented a charity circus in Hazazer’s Hall (where?) and publicized the Klan’s endorsement of Protestantism. Visits were made to the United Brethren Church (where?) and the Roland Avenue Methodist Church at 40th Street and Roland Avenue. The pastor of the latter church accepted a $25 check from the Klan, remarking, “I, for one, am glad to get it.” In March 1923, a Klan meeting at the Brooklyn First Baptist Church at 3801 5th Street was “almost broken up by an angry mob.”<span class="citation" data-cites="jackson_ku_1967"><a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The threat of violence was not limited to illegal lynchings but included the violence of Baltimore police officers. Noted incidents of police violence include the beating of a black soldier (criticized in February 1918 by Judge Robert F. Stanton who later served as Police Commissioner from 1938 to 1943); a 1918 shooting of a black man on Pennsylvania Avenue on June 1, 1918; Baltimore police officer James O. Jones in “beating up” Henry Boyer in 1926, the clubbing of Henry Simuels in 1927.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> As a student at the the Colored High School on Pennsylvania Avenue in the early 1920s, Thurgood Marshall had a close-up view of the Northwestern District Police Station and their treatment of black suspects. In <em>Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary</em>, Juan Williams quotes Marshall’s recollection of what he heard, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We could hear police in there beating the hell out of people, saying, ‘Black boy, why don’t you just shut your goddamned mouth, you’re going to talk yourself into the electric chair.’”<span class="citation" data-cites="williams_thurgood_2011"><a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p>

<h2 id="reaction-to-great-migration">Reaction to Great Migration</h2>
<p>Baltimore’s growing black population was the result of regional migration from Maryland and Virginia (different than the more typical patterns of the Great Migration in northern cities). However, the city was still greatly affected by this broader national change.</p>
<p>One example of this change was the growth of a new group of Civil Rights organizations whose primary mission focused on integrating new black migrants into cities. The National Urban League was established in New York City as the Committee on Urban Conditions Among Negroes, on September 29, 1910. In Baltimore, a local chapter of the Urban League was established in 1924.</p>
<p>Earlier efforts included the Women’s Cooperative Civic League:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Women’s Cooperative Civic League, an all-black female group, was formed in 1913 at the request of a group of white citizens to address housing, health, sanitation, and educational problems resulting from the rapid urban growth. Under the leadership of Sara Fernandis the city was organized into wards headed by community activists. By 1914, the membership had grown to 130.<span class="citation" data-cites="gordon_african_1997"><a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Baltimore’s black public schools were crowded and in disrepair, housed in the cast-off buildings left behind as whites moved to better facilities. …Despite the reorganization of the city government and the educational system, no new black schools were built between 1898 and 1915.<span class="citation" data-cites="roberts_infectious_2002"><a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1927, the state formed a new Interracial Commission.</p>
<h2 id="new-rights-for-women">New rights for women</h2>
<p>One of the most significant changes in this period was the expansion of voting rights for women through the Nineteenth Amendment which was ratified on August 26, 1920.</p>
<p>The modern history of the organized suffrage movement in Maryland began in 1909 when Edith Houghton Hooker founded the Just Government League of Maryland.</p>
<p>In 1919, Maryland’s Senators split over the issue of women’s suffrage with Democrat John Walter Smith voting against the amendment and Republican Senator Joseph I. France voting for it. When the measure came before the Maryland legislature on February 24, 1920, they rejected the amendment; in part due to concerns over the expansion of suffrage to black women at a time when many white Marylanders still wanted to see more restrictions on voting rights for African Americans.</p>
<p>On November 2, 1920, women voted for first time in Maryland and, in 1921, the Women’s Suffrage League of Maryland affiliated with the recently formed League of Women Voters of the United States. Finally, on November 7, 1922, a state (?) Constitutional amendment (Chapter 275, Acts of 1922) was ratified making women eligible to hold public office.</p>
<p>In 1920, the Colored Women’s YWCA became an official chapter of the Baltimore YWCA.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carrie Chapman Catt’s League of Women Voters and the Alice Paul-led Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (late known as the National Woman’s Party) both acted in coalition with southern white political leaders and their ideology of white supremacy.</p>

<p>The Negro Business League held their Ninth Annual Convention in Baltimore in 1908.</p>
<p>In 1927, the Maryland state legislature established the “Interracial Commission” (Chapter 559, Acts of 1927) to create a framework for discussing Civil Rights policy issues.</p>
<p>August 26, 1920:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nineteenth Amendment is ratified. Its victory accomplished, NAWSA ceases to exist, but its organization becomes the nucleus of the League of Women Voters.</p>
