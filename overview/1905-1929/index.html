  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As in other American cities, the Progressive Era (1900-1920) saw major changes to Baltimore’s urban landscape including a new park plan, a new sewer system, and a downtown transformed by the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904.</p>
<p>Baltimore experienced dramatic physical and political changes during the first few decades of the 20th century. Following the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904, the city finally undertook the creation of a new sewer system in 1915 after decades of delay. In 1918, Baltimore City annexed a large area of Baltimore County. The city’s overall population grew from around 509,000 in 1900 to 733,826 in 1920, reaching 804,874 people by 1930. The city’s black population grew from 79,000 in 1900 to 84,000 in 1910 to 108,322 in 1920 and 142,106 in 1930.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<!-- TODO: Find out about the patterns of migration to Baltimore during the Great Migration. The 1910 and 1920 population numbers referenced above are clearly approximate. -->
<p>In the antebellum period, most of the new black migrants to Baltimore City came from Maryland or Virginia — a pattern that largely continued into the early 20th century. In 1910, 87% of the black population in Baltimore was native to Maryland. Of the 13% born outside of the state, migrants from Virginia made up 8.7% of the total. In 1920, 76% of Baltimore’s black population was native to Maryland, in comparison to Detroit’s 8.4% or Manhattan’s 20.9%. In 1930, Baltimore had 59.4% of black residents (142,106) born in the state – a decline of 17.1% from 1910.<span class="citation" data-cites="reich_baltimore_2014"><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<!-- TODO: Add more information about the annexation and how it affected the city. Find 1920 and 1930 data for black population growth. -->
<!-- TODO: Write about economic challenges during this period, e.g. Panic of 1901, Panic of 1903, economic downturn following WWI, and the start of the Great Depression -->
<p>Notable individual activists and leaders in this period included City Councilman Harry S. Cummings (1866–1917); lawyers Everett J. Waring (1859–1914), Warner T. McGuinn (1859–1937), and George W. F. McMechen (1871–1961); editor Carl J. Murphy (1889–1967); pastor and educator Rev. James Robert Lincoln Diggs (1866-1922) at Trinity Baptist Church. Major organizations in this period included early Civil Rights organizations like the NAACP (established in 1909, with a Baltimore chapter beginning in 1912) and the Baltimore Urban League (established nationally in 1910, with a Baltimore chapter beginning in 1924). Other important groups included the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL) (established in 1914 with a Baltimore chapter operating by 1918); fraternal organizations such as the Monumental Lodge No. 3; and philanthropic groups such as the CYWCA and Colored Fresh Air Club (this name isn’t right - fix it!).</p>
<p>One of the most dramatic changes in this period was the continued movement of African Americans into northwest Baltimore where many buildings with important associations to this period of Civil Rights history still survive. For example, the former St. Peter’s P.E. Church (built 1868) was purchased by Bethel A.M.E. Church in 1910. Public School No. 103 (built 1877) was converted to use as black school in 1910. The Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA), Druid Hill Avenue Branch was built in 1917 (or 1919? Check this date!). In 1928, the Coppin Normal School, Colored Junior High School, and offices for the Baltimore colored school administration moved into the former Western High School building on McCulloh Street. In other parts of the city, examples include the Morgan Park neighborhood near Morgan State University where development began in 1917.</p>
<!-- TODO: Decide if it makes sense to note Preston Gardens (built 1917) as a significant site in this period. -->
<p>Major themes in the history of Civil Rights in this period include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing resistance to white efforts to impose housing segregation and disenfranchise black voters.</li>
<li>Continuing resistance to unjust violence (e.g. lynching) and criminal injustice directed against African Americans in Baltimore and elsewhere in Maryland.</li>
<li>Expansion of voting rights for women (including African American women) and the role of black women as organizers and activists.</li>
<li>Response to poverty and poor housing conditions for African Americans in Baltimore (often framed in the context migration of rural black residents from Maryland and Virginia to Baltimore).</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, local Civil Rights activism in Baltimore is increasingly tied to a broader national context and national movement. In 1905, Rev. Harvey Johnson and four other members of the Brotherhood of Liberty were among the twenty-nine people from fourteen states who met near Buffalo, New York to form the organization. Historian Bettye Collier-Thomas noted that W.E.B. DuBois was in “close contact with members of the Brotherhood… as he frequently traveled there to deliver speeches” between 1895 and 1910. Collier-Thomas notes, that the Brotherhood “willingly shared twenty years of experience, strategy development and know-how with the founders at Niagara.”<span class="citation" data-cites="collier-thomas_harvey_1991"><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> The Niagara Movement ended after just a few years but led to the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. The National Urban League, organized with a clear focus on the needs of black migrants to northern and border state cities was established just a year later in 1910.</p>

</ul>
<p>But shift to focus on exclusion through other means, e.g. “protective” associations,</p>
<h2 id="violence-and-criminal-injustice">Violence and criminal injustice</h2>
<p>This period saw a surge of white violence against African Americans in Maryland and in cities around the country. One example from Maryland, notable for the proximity to Baltimore, was the lynching of King Johnson in Brooklyn, Maryland on December 26, 1911.</p>
<p>Nationally, mob violence against black communities:</p>
<ul>
<li>East St. Louis, Illinois Riot, July 2, 1917 - killed at least 39 black people and 8 white, injured hundreds, millions of damages. Mass meeting held at AME Cuhurch in response</li>
<li>Washington, DC Riot in July 19 - 22 1919,</li>
<li>Chicago Riot, July 27 - August 23, 1919</li>
<li>Tulsa Riot, May 31 - June 1, 1921</li>
<li>Elaine, Arkansas Riot, September 30 - October 1, 1923</li>
</ul>
<p>These events took place concurrently with the local and national resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan. On October 10, 1922, the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in Annapolis and organized other rallies in Frederick and Baltimore that same year. In early 1923, the Ku Klux Klan presented a charity circus in Hazazer’s Hall (where?) and publicized the Klan’s endorsement of Protestantism. Visits were made to the United Brethren Church (where?) and the Roland Avenue Methodist Church at 40th Street and Roland Avenue. The pastor of the latter church accepted a $25 check from the Klan, remarking, “I, for one, am glad to get it.” In March 1923, a Klan meeting at the Brooklyn First Baptist Church at 3801 5th Street was “almost broken up by an angry mob.”<span class="citation" data-cites="jackson_ku_1967"><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The threat of violence was not limited to illegal lynchings but included the violence of Baltimore police officers. Noted incidents of police violence include the beating of a black soldier (criticized in February 1918 by Judge Robert F. Stanton who later served as Police Commissioner from 1938 to 1943); a 1918 shooting of a black man on Pennsylvania Avenue on June 1, 1918; Baltimore police officer James O. Jones in “beating up” Henry Boyer in 1926, the clubbing of Henry Simuels in 1927.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> As a student at the the Colored High School on Pennsylvania Avenue in the early 1920s, Thurgood Marshall had a close-up view of the Northwestern District Police Station and their treatment of black suspects. In <em>Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary</em>, Juan Williams quotes Marshall’s recollection of what he heard, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We could hear police in there beating the hell out of people, saying, ‘Black boy, why don’t you just shut your goddamned mouth, you’re going to talk yourself into the electric chair.’”<span class="citation" data-cites="williams_thurgood_2011"><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1925, the Conference of AME Ministers sets up a committee to consider the best way to place black officers on the police force.<span class="citation" data-cites="farrar_baltimore_1998"><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> In a 1926 report on capital punishment in Maryland the <em>Afro-American</em> newspaper called for an end to the death penalty pointing out that between 1903 and 1926, nine of the ten men executed in Maryland for murder or rape were black.<span class="citation" data-cites="farrar_baltimore_1998"><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>

<li>National Urban League established, September 29, 1910</li>
<li>Baltimore Urban League established 1924</li>
<li>Interracial Commission, 1927</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-rights-for-women">New rights for women</h2>
<p>One of the most significant changes in this period was the expansion of voting rights for women through the Nineteenth Amendment which was ratified on August 26, 1920. In 1919, Maryland’s Senators split over the issue in congress with Democrat John Walter Smith voting against the amendment and Republican Senator Joseph I. France voting for it. When the measure came before Maryland voters on February 24, 1920, it was rejected the amendment ; in part due to concerns over the expansion of suffrage to black women at a time when many white Marylanders wanted to restrict voting rights for African Americans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Women’s Cooperative Civic League, an all-black female group, was formed in 1913 at the request of a group of white citizens to address housing, health, sanitation, and educational problems resulting from the rapid urban growth. Under the leadership of Sara Fernandis the city was organized into wards headed by community activists. By 1914, the membership had grown to 130.<span class="citation" data-cites="gordon_african_1997"><a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>

<ul>
<li>On November 2, 1920, women voted for first time in Maryland.</li>
<li>In 1921, the Women’s Suffrage League of Maryland affiliated with the recently formed League of Women Voters of the United States</li>
<li>On November 7, 1922, a state (?) Constitutional amendment (Chapter 275, Acts of 1922) was ratified making women eligible to hold public office.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Negro Business League held their Ninth Annual Convention in Baltimore in 1908.</p>
<p>In 1920, the Colored Women’s YWCA became an official chapter of the Baltimore YWCA.</p>
<p>In 1927, the Maryland state legislature established the “Interracial Commission” (Chapter 559, Acts of 1927) to create a framework for discussing Civil Rights policy issues.</p>
