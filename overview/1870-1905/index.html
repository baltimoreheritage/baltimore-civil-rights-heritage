<p>Between 1870 and 1905, African Americans in Baltimore and Maryland saw both new opportunities and difficult reversals. After the Civil War, the Thirteenth (1865), Fourteenth (1868) and Fifteenth (1870) Amendments to the U.S. Constitution laid out a promise of freedom, equal protection, and political power for African Americans in Baltimore and Maryland. Baltimoreans saw the first African American lawyer join the Maryland State Bar, the first hospital established by African American doctors, the first black teachers work for Baltimore’s segregated black public schools, and the first black member of the Baltimore City Council.</p>
<p>In this same period, however, local, state, and federal elected officials often failed to protect the rights of black Baltimoreans or actively worked against their interests. Unlike in those states that joined the Confederacy, Maryland never experienced a period of direct federal control and Reconstruction. Maryland’s Democratic Party, led by some of the same individuals who had supported or fought on behalf of the Confederacy during the Civil War, controlled most of the elected offices in the city and state with only a few brief exceptions. Even those white Republicans who sought support from black voters, often supported racist policies. These conditions forced black Baltimoreans to both lobby white-dominated institutions and organize independently to pursue their goals.</p>
<p>Notable individuals working in this period included religious leaders like Dr. Harvey Johnson (1843–1923) at Union Baptist Church—who worked closely with his wife, Amelia E. Hall (1858-1922)—and Rev. George Freeman Bragg (1863 - 1940) at St. James Church. It also included business owners like Isaac Myers (1835–1891); black lawyers like Everett J. Waring (1859–1914) and Harry S. Cummings (1866-1917); educators like Roberta Sheridan (c. 1864–1918) and Joseph H. Lockerman (d. 1923). Others included John M. Murphy, Sr. (1840-1922) who founded the Afro-American newspaper and Martha Murphy (1846-1915) who helped to found the Colored YWCA in 1896. Influential Civil Rights organizations included the Equal Rights League, the Mutual United Brotherhood of Liberty (established 1885), and the Maryland Teachers’ Association (organized in 1886).</p>
<p>Within the city, major factors that shaped the changing history of Civil Rights included the wave of suburban development in the late nineteenth century centered around Baltimore City’s 1888 annexation of Baltimore County. This annexation and the development of new electric streetcar lines in the early 1890s promoted significant changes in the development of the city that supported the growth of racial segregation in the early twentieth century. Looking outside of Baltimore, the events of this period were shaped by the decades long period of economic depression that followed the Panic of 1873 and by the increasing European immigration to the United States.</p>
<!-- TODO: Citation needed on the re-integration of Confederate supporters into Baltimore and Maryland politics. More information on the policies/racism of white Republicans might be helpful. -->
<p>In the following sections, this study expands on three key themes, considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>African American residents efforts to secure opportunities for housing, education, and employment in Baltimore</li>
<li>African American resistance to segregation and discrimination</li>
<li>African American organizing to build political and financial support for Civil Rights</li>
</ul>
<p>As in the prior context covering the period from 1831-1870, many important sites related to this period were demolished during the 20th century. The Douglass Institute on Lexington Street, an important meeting place for political activism in the 19th century, was destroyed in the early 20th century. Laurel Cemetery, a black cemetery established in 1851 that became an important memorial site for veterans of the U.S. Colored Troops, was displaced in 1957 for the construction of a shopping center and parking lot. In a more recent example, the Harry S. Cummings Residence at 1234 Druid Hill Avenue was demolished in October 2015.</p>
<p>In other cases, resources still exist but are threatened or partially compromised by neglect or vacancy, such as Public School No. 111 (built in 1889); Public School No. 103; and the Everett J. Waring Residence at 507 Mosher Street.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Examples of better preserved resources include Douglass Place (built 1892); Mount Auburn Cemetery (established 1873); Public School No. 9 at 1431 N. Carey Street; Leadenhall Baptist Church (built 1872-1873); Saint Peter Claver Catholic Church (built 1888); and Sharp Street Church (built 1892).</p>

<!-- Map of Baltimore in 1870 showing the percentage of the population identified as black in each ward. -->
<p>After the Civil War, thousands of formerly enslaved black people moved from rural counties in Maryland and Virginia to seek work and protection from white violence in Baltimore City. Between 1870 and 1900, Baltimore’s black population grew quickly—from 47,921 in 1870 to 54,000 in 1880 to 79,000 in 1900.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Many of the migrants from southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore fled from poverty and violence. Describing this period of growth based solely on the U.S. Census likely understates the true scale. Historian Richard Paul Fuke looked at the growth in black households listed in Woods’ City Directory noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between 1864 and 1871, the number of black householders listed in the Woods’ City Directory tripled from 4,000 to 12,000.<span class="citation" data-cites="fuke_imperfect_1999"><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the new migrants struggled to find housing in the immediate post-Civil War period, as Fuke noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within a month of emancipation, the Friends Association reported “many calls from women with children… who have neither food not shelter.” “We find more suffering than we are able to alleviate,” it added in January 1865, “They [are in] want of the most necessary food and clothing, and have crowded into alleys and callers.”<span class="citation" data-cites="fuke_imperfect_1999"><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As African Americans neighborhoods grew around Courtland Street near downtown, Orchard Street in West Baltimore, and Hughes Street in South Baltimore, a number of the well-established black Baltimoreans, largely free prior to the Civil War, invested in real estate and prospered in the growing city. In <em>Aristocrats of Color: the Black Elite 1880-1920</em>, Willard B. Gatewood wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compared to the economic status of the vast majority of Baltimore’s large black population, those who constituted the city’s aristocracy of color were relatively well-to-do. A black editor calculated in 1890 that about twenty individuals in the city’s black community collectively represented a wealth of approximately $500,000. The wealthiest, John Locks, was said to be worth $75,000. Many of those included in Baltimore’s black economic elite derived their wealth from catering, barbering, hod-carrying, brickmaking, and caulking. … Many of these individuals invested in real estate, so that by the turn of the century their heirs were often among the wealthiest blacks in the city.<span class="citation" data-cites="gatewood_jr._aristocrats_2000"><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>John W. Locks owned a hack and funeral business.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Historian Jeffrey Richardson Brackett made a similar observation in his 1890 study, <em>Notes on the Progress of the Colored People of Maryland Since the War</em> writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been said that in no city are there so many colored house-holders as in Baltimore. Many of the wealthy colored men have invested largely in houses in a few cases, a whole row is owned by one man. The extent of the town, the number of alleys, and the great number of small houses, of two stories only, facilitate this for one must not suppose that the seventy-five houses said to be owned by one colored citizen of Annapolis, for instance, are all expensive buildings or on valuable ground.<span class="citation" data-cites="brackett_notes_1890"><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the city’s black population grew, it also become more concentrated and segregated from the city’s population of native-born whites and European immigrants. Even as late as 1880, the city’s black population could be found distributed evenly over three-quarters of Baltimore’s 20 wards and 8 districts. By 1890, however, African Americans began to concentrate in 11th Ward (the neighborhood of Biddle Alley) where a little over 11,000 of the 21,2699 residents were African American (making the ward 51.74% black). By 1904, the city’s Northwestern District (including the 11th Ward) held more than 40% of Baltimore’s 81,381 African Americans.<span class="citation" data-cites="jr_infectious_2009"><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This movement of African Americans into west and northwest Baltimore is particularly visible in the movement of African American congregations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Macedonia Baptist Church erected a new building at 1617 W. Saratoga Street in 1876</li>
<li>St. Peter Claver Catholic Church dedicated a new building at N. Fremont Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue in 1888</li>
<li>Sharp Street Church moved from Sharp Street south of Pratt Street to Dolphin and Etting Street in 1898</li>
<li>St. James Episcopal Church moved from Lexington and High Street to Park Avenue and Preston Street in 1901</li>
<li>Union Baptist moved to Druid Hill Avenue in 1910</li>
<li>Bethel AME Church moved to Lanvale Street and Druid Hill Avenue in 1911</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This pattern continued into the 1920s and 1930s then repeated itself again in the 1950s and 1960s. {: .notice–warning}</p>
<p>The movement by African Americans out of older neighborhoods into the northwestern part of the was enabled, in part, by the new opportunities that black Baltimoreans had to earn money and acquire wealth. Examples of these new opportunities include the founding of Provident Hospital in 1894 by Dr. J. Marcus Cargill and others—creating jobs for black doctors and nurses and expanding medical care for black Baltimoreans; or in, 1888, when Baltimore began hiring black teachers for the city’s public schools.<span class="citation" data-cites="jackson_history_1967"><a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span> Similarly the movement by African Americans to purchase and rent homes in northwest Baltimore often represented an effort to seek better housing conditions. Anne McMechen, George McMechen’s wife, reflected on the universal character of their aspirations in their move to McCulloh Street, explaining, “we wanted to be more comfortable—a right I think everyone has to exercise.”<span class="citation" data-cites="halpin_reforming_2012"><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<p>One of the most notable efforts to open new employment opportunities to African Americans in this period was the campaign to open teaching jobs at black schools to black educators. In 1888, the policy barring African American teachers finally changed. <a href="http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/012300/012385/html/12385bio.html">Roberta Sheridan</a> was among the first group of black teachers when she appointed as a teacher in the “Waverly Colored Public School”. Historian Leroy Graham wrote, “With the acceptance of black teachers and a publicly funded high school, the blacks of Baltimore could breathe a sigh of relief after such a long and difficult struggle.”<span class="citation" data-cites="graham_baltimore_1982"><a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This paragraph on the campaign to hire black teachers at black schools should be expanded. {: .notice–warning}</p>
<h2 id="fighting-segregation-and-discrimination">Fighting segregation and discrimination</h2>
<p>In Baltimore, new federal Civil Rights laws, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1866, did help African American make legal and social demands for equal access and opportunity. For example, in February 1871, John W. Fields, a black barber visiting Baltimore from Virginia, was ejected from a Baltimore streetcar. Fields sued and won a judgement against the trolley company that forced the integration of municipal transit in Baltimore.<span class="citation" data-cites="bogen_precursors_2004"><a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> In 1880, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in <em>Strauder v. West Virginia</em> overturned Maryland’s prohibition on black jurors. Black leadership played an important role in enabling further activism, as African Americans in Baltimore could hire black lawyers beginning in 1885 when Everett J. Waring was admitted to practice law in Baltimore, and when they were represented by black elected officials, beginning in 1890 when Harry S. Cummings was elected to the Baltimore City Council.</p>
<p>In the 1880s, 1890s, and 1900s, however, action by African Americans was met with white reaction, as historian Grace Elizabeth Hale observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whites created the culture of segregation in large part to counter black success, to make a myth of racial difference, to stop the rising.<span class="citation" data-cites="hale_making_2010"><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, the Maryland Legislature to reaffirm their opposition to interracial marriage in 1884 and to impose “Jim Crow” segregation on railroad coaches and steamboats in Maryland in 1904. Many embraced the narrative of the “Lost Cause” which rewrote the history of the Civil War and celebrated the Confederacy with a new monument on Mount Royal Avenue in 1903.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1904, voters across Maryland considered the “Poe Suffrage Amendment” which sought to disenfranchise black voters and, as early as 1907, some white residents Baltimore began advocating for municipal laws to enforce racial segregation.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1891, Baltimore resident and Maryland Senator William Cabell Bruce published an influential pamphlet entitled “The Negro Problem” which outlined a case for black disenfranchisement based on foundation of scientific racism. At the national level, this reaction included the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Civil Rights Cases (1883) which ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was unconstitutional; the defeat of the Lodge Force Bill due in part to the efforts of Maryland Senator Arthur Pue Gorman; and the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) which advanced the idea that segregated public facilities were legal under the doctrine of “separate but equal”.</p>
<!-- TODO: I know I read something with more detail on William Cabell Bruce's racism but I can't recall where. -->
<p>One consequence of this rising racism was the rising threat of lynchings in Maryland and across the south. Between 1882 and 1911, white people in Maryland lynched thirty-one African Americans. In Baltimore, black residents were deprived of equal protection by Baltimore’s police and, if they were subjected to violence by white residents, they had great difficulty getting justice.</p>
<p>Even in Baltimore City, when white residents attacked black men and women they had little fear of penalty. Historian Richard Paul Fuke noted the “fatal police shooting of Eliza Taylor, a black woman, in September 1867,” quoting the <em>Baltimore American</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A colored woman was killed under circumstances which show the spirit of hate and oppression cherished toward that portion of the population by many of the police.<span class="citation" data-cites="fuke_imperfect_1999"><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The police officer involved in the shooting was acquitted of murder prompting criticism from a convention of black leaders in Baltimore, as the Baltimore American reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The President [George A. Hackett] stated the object of the meeting, quoting the Declaration of Independence in proof of the fact that the colored people have no friends in Baltimore in the Governor or the police, and cited the action of the Grand Jury in discharging the Policeman Frey, charged with the murder of the colored woman, Eliza Taylor, as a specimen of the justice which is meted out to colored people in this city.<span class="citation" data-cites="fuke_imperfect_1999"><a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a later example, activist and journalist Ida B. Wells cited one example from Baltimore in <em>The Red Record</em> (her study of lynchings in the early 1890s), describing how:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>who was out walking with a young man of her own race. They held her escort and outraged the girls… The case went to the courts and they were acquitted.<span class="citation" data-cites="wells-barnett_red_1895"><a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This activism served to defend gains in housing and employment made by African Americans and to create new opportunities. E</p>
<p>Halpin credits Dr. Harvey Johnson of Union Baptist Church along with the men and women who created and supported the Brotherhood of Liberty, Baltimore’s earliest Civil Rights advocacy organization, with enabling a degree of freedom within Baltimore’s black community that distinguished it from many other cities. Halpin writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wave of racial repression that swept over the southern United States largely stopped at Baltimore’s doorstep. Although black Baltimoreans and Marylanders did not wholly escape violence or racism, white attempts at disfranchisement and segregation floundered. This was not a coincidence. Black communities in Baltimore (and to an extent Maryland) were uniquely equipped to fight inequality and resist Jim Crow, largely thanks to Johnson and the many thousands who joined or supported him during the previous two decades.<span class="citation" data-cites="halpin_reforming_2012"><a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, Dr. Johnson’s experience in Baltimore led him support the creation of the Niagara Movement and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)—prefiguring the national significance of Civil Rights activism in Baltimore during the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Dennis Halpin highlighted four issues addressed by the Brotherhood of Liberty as some of the most important in the 1880s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…amending the state Bastardy Act, challenging the laws prohibiting intermarriage, agitating for improved education, and the Navassa Island trial—to document how black activists sought to further define the implications of the Fourteenth Amendment, draw the wider community into activism, and seek redress for various injustices. The Brotherhood’s use of test cases became the boilerplate for much of the early twentieth century African-American freedom movement.<span class="citation" data-cites="halpin_reforming_2012"><a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Civil Rights activism took place in parallel to independent political organizing where black voters worked both inside and outside of the Republican Party and established white institutions to create a platform for advocating for African American Civil Rights.</p>

<h3 id="activism-and-organizing">Activism and organizing</h3>
<p>Despite these challenges, African American activists succeeded in gaining a small measure of economic security, successfully defended the right to vote for black men, and continue to campaign for equality in education and housing. In contrast to a perception that change for African Americans in Maryland ended with the end of Reconstruction in 1877, historian Dennis P. Halpin writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…In fact, black activists in Baltimore spent a majority of the early 1880s attacking a host of injustices—collectively referred to as “black laws”— which had roots in the antebellum era.<span class="citation" data-cites="halpin_reforming_2012"><a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such activist efforts led to key legal victories in 1885 when the Stewart Sisters successfully sued the Baltimore, Chesapeake, and Richmond Steamboat Co. for racial discrimination and when Charles L. Wilson succeeded in his suit to overturn the exclusion of African Americans by the Maryland Bar.<span class="citation" data-cites="halpin_reforming_2012"><a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Dennis P. Halpin writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the early 1900s, black activists laid a foundation to thwart white efforts at disfranchisement and residential segregation in the city. Baltimore’s activists were among the earliest members of the Niagara Movement in the early 1900s, an organization that eventually became the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). At the same time, their use of “test cases” to challenge and further define the legacy of Reconstruction set the course for black activism that lasted until 1954’s landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education.<span class="citation" data-cites="halpin_reforming_2012"><a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></span></p>

<p>Between 1883 and 1905, the Maryland General Assembly passed a series of regressive measures to promote and enforce racial discrimination. These including an 1884 law banning interracial marriage (reaffirming a ban on interracial marriage from 1664), 1904 measures to require “Jim Crow” racial segregation on railroad coaches and steamboats, and a 1905 measure to disenfranchise African Americans (rejected at the polls by Maryland voters). The limited success of these efforts in Maryland in comparison to other Southern states is notable—reflecting both the size and the organization of Baltimore’s African American community.</p>
<h2 id="african-americans-organized-independent-political-and-civil-rights-advocacy-groups">African Americans organized independent political and Civil Rights advocacy groups</h2>
<p>The ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 added 39,000 new black voters to the total of 131,000 white voters registered in the state. Despite African American men voting in support of the Republicans, the Democratic Party candidate won the Governor’s office in every election from 1866 to 1896. Similarly, the Mayor of Baltimore remained Democratic (or a related party) from <a href="http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/012400/012477/html/12477bio.html">Mayor Robert T. Banks</a> (the first elected under the new State Constitution adopted in 1867) up until the election of Republican Alcaeus Hooper in 1895.</p>
<!-- TODO: How much of the above Democratic control of local politics was related to voter suppression in southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore? Could black men vote safely and easily in Baltimore City even? -->

<p>At the federal level, the withdrawal of Union troops from the South marked the end of Reconstruction and, as the <em>NHL Civil Rights Framework</em> notes, “the concept of equal rights collapsed in the wake of legislative and judicial actions”, continuing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Republican and Democratic parties sacrificed civil rights in exchange for white southern votes. In the <em>Civil Rights Cases</em> of 1883, the U.S. Supreme Court found the statutory guarantee of equal enjoyment of public accommodations unconstitutional on the grounds that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment only applied to state activities and did not permit federal control of individual actions.  This decision greatly limited the rights of blacks and strengthened Jim Crow laws in the South.<span class="citation" data-cites="national_historic_landmarks_program_civil_2002"><a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The failure of the Republican Party to support the interests of black Baltimoreans led many to begin organizing new independent organizations. In February 1880, a convention of “colored delegates from each ward of the city” met at the Douglass Institute on Lexington Street to organize a new “Equal-Rights League.” The meeting heard speeches from Rev. John A. Handy, James Taylor, N.C.M. Groome, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Myers">Isaac Myers</a> and <a href="http://history.house.gov/People/Listing/H/HARALSON,-Jeremiah-(H000179)/">Jeremiah Haralson</a>. Myers observed how in Maryland:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Colored men cannot sit upon juries, colored children cannot be taught in the public schools by teachers of their own race, and colored people cannot get accommodations in hotels nor be admitted to practice as lawyers in State courts. By units of action the colored people will secure these rights and privileges.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harrison, a former Congressman from Alabama who had been forced by an armed mob to flee the state in 1878, remarked that the “colored people in Maryland are free compared with their race in Alabama and the far South, where they are now fleeing from ‘a second slavery that is more damnable than the first.’” The discussion continued past midnight before the meeting concluded with a resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They set forth that neither the republican nor democratic parties in this State accord equal rights to the colored man, and the organization is promoted to secure him his rights and the respect to which he is entitled as a citizen.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This movement to independent black organizations led to changes for African Americans churches as well as political parties. In 1885, <a href="http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/stagser/s1259/121/6050/html/12414000.html">Rev. Harvey Johnson</a> (1843-1923) founded the Order of Regulators, another early Civil Rights organization, which Johnson renamed the Brotherhood of Liberty in 1887. Under Rev. Johnson’s leadership, the Union Baptist Church withdrew from the 1892, the Union Baptist Church withdrew from the Maryland Baptist Union Association in response to discriminatory pay for black pastors and unequal privileges for black churches within the government of the association. In September 1897, Rev. Johnson delivered a speech in Boston, titled “A Plea For Our Work As Colored Baptists, Apart From the Whites,” that criticized white churches for their failure to support black Civil Rights efforts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why is the proposition never made to us of the necessity of co-operating in the work of abating the many forms of legal and socially oppressive laws and customs now in vogue all over the country, both North and South?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1898, Rev. Johnson organized the Colored Baptist Convention of Maryland. Rev. Johnson also later played an active role in the founding of the Niagara Movement on July 1, 1905.</p>
<p>During the same period, between 1856 and 1900, thirty-one black newspapers were established in Baltimore. In 1892, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Murphy,_Sr.">John H. Murphy, Sr.</a> (1841-1922), a U.S. Colored Troop veteran, established the Afro-American newspaper by merging his own church newsletter <em>The Sunday School Helper</em> with two other publications, <em>The Ledger</em>, established in 1882 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Freeman_Bragg">Rev. George Freeman Bragg</a>, rector of St. James Episcopal Church since 1891, and <em>The Afro-American</em>, published by Reverend William M. Alexander, Sharon Baptist Church.</p>

<p>About Amelia Hall and literature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in 1887, she began to publish a monthly literary magazine, The Joy, as an outlet for black writers, especially females, and an inspirational resource for black youth. Filled with short-stories, poetry, and literary items of interest, The Joy was well received and praised. Amelia Johnson also published work in newspapers, both secular and church-affilated. In fact, during the early 1890s, she penned a regular column, “Children’s Corner,” in the Baltimore Sower and Reaper.</p>

<h3 id="white-supremacy">White supremacy</h3>
<p>In Maryland, as well as many other Southern states, African Americans fought to preserve their right to vote, their right to equal accommodation on public transportation, and their right to fair housing opportunities. Their efforts were met with opposition and resistance by racist white Marylanders.</p>
<p>Changes in public policy paralleled changes to the broader culture, including the growing cultural significance of the “Lost Cause”, social darwinism and scientific racism contributed to a difficult situation. This change is reflected in part through a memorial landscape in Baltimore that celebrated Confederate supporters and Confederate symbols including those built after the period of this context:</p>
